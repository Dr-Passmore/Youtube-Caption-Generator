00:00:00,479 --> 00:00:03,967
hello today I'm going to talk about my overlocker other ways if you like the studio

1
00:00:04,064 --> 00:00:07,840
and Clyde timore please don't forget to like unsubscribe if you haven't already so my overlocker

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:14,368
is the singer fourteen as H seven five for this is a budget overlocker machines so

3
00:00:14,560 --> 00:00:18,944
I think I spent about two hundred pounds on it that was the sale price and

4
00:00:19,007 --> 00:00:23,360
but I think it was fairly frequently on the same I'm not sure if it's quite

5
00:00:23,423 --> 00:00:30,143
the same as the one that frequently appears in little I bought this a bars possibly

6
00:00:30,208 --> 00:00:34,591
seven or eight years ago so it's I've had it quite a while now and I

7
00:00:34,720 --> 00:00:40,096
thought I felt like I've had enough experience with that now to share my opinion of

8
00:00:40,159 --> 00:00:44,352
it and the first thing I guess when discussing overlook is a key question of someone

9
00:00:44,383 --> 00:00:48,512
without one would be do you need an overlocker I would say that since having the

10
00:00:48,608 --> 00:00:53,759
overlocker I have already looked back it is a complete game changer to your sewing if

11
00:00:53,791 --> 00:00:59,040
your dress-making it makes it so much work or because you can just finish off those

12
00:00:59,071 --> 00:01:05,407
things superquick and oversee if you're serving with nets it's even faster you can definitely make

13
00:01:05,791 --> 00:01:11,136
a nice pop in a very short space of time however saying that it is quite

14
00:01:11,232 --> 00:01:14,816
the financial cost still even if you're buying a budget machine like this it's still too

15
00:01:14,912 --> 00:01:18,879
into found out of your pocket it's a whole other machine to hole somewhere in your

16
00:01:18,944 --> 00:01:23,519
home the main role of the block is to finish off scenes and you can obviously

17
00:01:23,807 --> 00:01:29,440
do that with your regular social machine you can do is it a stitch you can

18
00:01:29,503 --> 00:01:35,552
do an overgod stitch you can sometimes get and special feet for your sewing machine and

19
00:01:35,583 --> 00:01:40,288
this job as a job as well and it just it normally takes a bit more

20
00:01:40,384 --> 00:01:44,192
time but I oracy depends how good your time vagina's as well there are quite a

21
00:01:44,288 --> 00:01:50,015
few models of overlookers out in the market so as I mentioned to render fans probably

22
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:54,047
the the lower end of how much you spend on an overlocker I think you can

23
00:01:54,335 --> 00:02:00,959
get the single model that the little for possibly violet cheaper the land saying that but

24
00:02:01,248 --> 00:02:06,975
also they can go right up to quite a hefty amounts more around a thousand pounds

25
00:02:07,136 --> 00:02:13,151
or more and a lot of these machines do have a special features so for example

26
00:02:13,632 --> 00:02:20,223
they can do things like and little answer is technology so it's a lot easier to

27
00:02:20,287 --> 00:02:25,119
throw the machine which I will go through I'm sweating the machine with this one but

28
00:02:25,248 --> 00:02:30,335
anyway the air Fred technologies meant to be absolutely amazing and anyone who felt have an

29
00:02:30,399 --> 00:02:35,776
overlocker will know that it can be a right pain if I'm you know something goes

30
00:02:35,839 --> 00:02:40,095
wrong and you have to rethread the whole machine it can take quite a long time

31
00:02:40,447 --> 00:02:45,343
another thing to fun stood out when you're buying an overlocker is how many threats it

32
00:02:45,408 --> 00:02:50,432
can overlock with so at this particular model you can decide whether to

33
00:02:51,488 --> 00:02:56,063
use it with two trips or for so currently I have got three threats threaded up

34
00:02:56,223 --> 00:02:59,231
in the machine this is because I was trying to do a rolled him

35
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:06,048
for the last grass I made and if the hands isn't actually use it so I

36
00:03:06,143 --> 00:03:10,048
quite liked the fact that you can decide how many friends she wants it's a really

37
00:03:10,111 --> 00:03:13,856
good idea to use the for thread overlook if you are saying with nets and not

38
00:03:13,919 --> 00:03:21,503
using the sewing machine to undo the seams initially because then you've brought them good reinforcement

39
00:03:21,759 --> 00:03:27,807
you might want use the three stitch overlock for I'm finishing off the seams if you

40
00:03:27,871 --> 00:03:32,255
were to use this own machine and straight stitch first so you don't need quite the

41
00:03:32,384 --> 00:03:38,815
security of a for threat o'clock search muds you still oracy need to finish off the

42
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:45,983
road edges and then oversee as two threads overlock is very useful you can do much

43
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:50,975
more delicate stitches and as a mentions you can do a roll down here so if

44
00:03:51,039 --> 00:03:56,320
you are looking for an overlocker you may want to review the different types of stitches

45
00:03:56,416 --> 00:04:01,024
you can do on the machine because this could affect your choice I really briefly mentioned

46
00:04:01,055 --> 00:04:05,376
about threading machines and I'd say as far as this one goes that it is quite

47
00:04:05,472 --> 00:04:10,527
a challenge to threat although I think anyone who's going opa-locka unless it's one of those

48
00:04:10,591 --> 00:04:15,904
really high-end air threating machines would say that it is the challenge to thread and overlocker

49
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:18,175
so it is the slot in it but

50
00:04:19,679 --> 00:04:24,895
my machine so you threats the lower lupa's you through its down one to hear which

51
00:04:25,088 --> 00:04:26,111
is fine but then

52
00:04:27,455 --> 00:04:32,287
for which one is it so it's the yellow threat on my machine so the second

53
00:04:32,704 --> 00:04:36,320
one you threads which is actually it goes through this style

54
00:04:37,503 --> 00:04:44,640
you have to hook it on to this little arm mechanism and it's really challenging to

55
00:04:44,704 --> 00:04:49,247
do this some overlookers you can actually open up this light

56
00:04:50,303 --> 00:04:53,791
and and it helps you to get the friend three where is this one you really

57
00:04:53,824 --> 00:04:54,463
have to kind of

58
00:04:55,839 --> 00:05:02,079
happily ease it into the position so I would say that is a slight drawback drawback

59
00:05:02,175 --> 00:05:07,328
with the design and anyone might tell you with changing perirectal need locker provided that

60
00:05:08,511 --> 00:05:15,135
you haven't and you know that threatened snapped you could just cut the thread at the

61
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:19,679
top and then tie on your new color then you settle detention loves the zero and

62
00:05:19,712 --> 00:05:24,000
then you can feed it through carefully this is a much break away of grief and

63
00:05:24,063 --> 00:05:28,671
changing the color will be alter it on on your overlocker but we see you can't

64
00:05:28,735 --> 00:05:29,440
always a point

65
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:36,895
actually manually rethreading the whole machine if you know I'm Uther it had snapped or something

66
00:05:36,992 --> 00:05:41,183
else has happened and a lot of the time if the attention is right or it's

67
00:05:41,279 --> 00:05:46,592
not working correctly and you will say this bet is to take all the threats out

68
00:05:46,752 --> 00:05:51,519
and rethread it from scratch because a lot the time that does a result the issues

69
00:05:51,552 --> 00:05:55,776
you have to come from us that I do quite like this color coded system and

70
00:05:56,351 --> 00:05:59,648
it is really nice that it does have a guide ottenere so I don't need to

71
00:05:59,679 --> 00:06:03,359
look at the manual whenever I want to rethread it so this guide on the right-hand

72
00:06:03,424 --> 00:06:08,959
side I'm in slide the own locker is really useful for rethreading say how can you

73
00:06:09,055 --> 00:06:13,119
step for a while and you can't quite remember which order you should threats the machine

74
00:06:13,216 --> 00:06:15,455
and it shows you here so it sits

75
00:06:16,608 --> 00:06:20,256
what will they need to thread the machine and three down brands of Wasim are really

76
00:06:20,287 --> 00:06:25,503
useful because and they can help you adjust attention on your machine it's always valuable to

77
00:06:25,567 --> 00:06:31,040
have your manual to and because it will have the right on how to adjust to

78
00:06:31,359 --> 00:06:35,328
the tension there and it was a in a fit if it looks like this then

79
00:06:35,424 --> 00:06:40,704
you need to tighten attention dial for this one but loosen it for another one but

80
00:06:40,768 --> 00:06:43,967
yeah this is a really good quick reference if you know you don't have it all

81
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:48,640
overlock man you to hand so I do really like this little panel here it's very

82
00:06:48,735 --> 00:06:53,407
useful and and even less recently when I was playing around with the wrong time option

83
00:06:54,048 --> 00:06:59,231
and this is released will just to bind you how to attach the road him the

84
00:06:59,328 --> 00:07:04,544
sun attachment thing what it's called it does have us depicting actually I'm talking about rolled

85
00:07:04,608 --> 00:07:09,664
hands it does have a specific setting so it's a little I'm dial on the inside

86
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:14,752
which you switch from the s which is to the search and and then you can

87
00:07:15,007 --> 00:07:16,384
move over to the offer road

88
00:07:17,407 --> 00:07:22,592
so and I think it's us the surgeon might actually just the standard overlocking so yeah

89
00:07:22,687 --> 00:07:26,463
normally I'll have it only as mode but then you can move it to our if

90
00:07:26,528 --> 00:07:32,127
you need to do a roll him and this just helps make these digital more refined

91
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:38,656
you come to a just how far away the upper cutting blades is there's a little

92
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:41,055
dying on the inside as well so it just adjusts how

93
00:07:42,144 --> 00:07:46,528
thick you're making your overlocked edge which comes in handy

94
00:07:47,936 --> 00:07:53,088
and there's also a differential seaters so it just gives you the opportunity to either create

95
00:07:53,152 --> 00:07:58,944
gathers or ruffles depending what you're trying to achieve and oversee year so if you've got

96
00:07:59,135 --> 00:08:02,496
up on the side of well you can change the stitch length which is tickly handy

97
00:08:02,592 --> 00:08:06,752
if you are trying to a general them so you'll want to and put the number

98
00:08:06,847 --> 00:08:10,239
right down or you can oversee and make it larger

99
00:08:11,264 --> 00:08:16,256
if you are working with much thicker fabric and you live once one of the city

100
00:08:16,351 --> 00:08:20,608
bunched up this regime also has a free arm options so I just

101
00:08:24,096 --> 00:08:24,799
kind of love you

102
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:30,272
this section

103
00:08:31,743 --> 00:08:31,839
so

104
00:08:32,927 --> 00:08:37,728
that can be really useful as well not a central but quite useful and that as

105
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:42,528
you can see so on some models you can then actually see the other side and

106
00:08:42,559 --> 00:08:47,903
that can help with trending if it is exposed but then oversee it helps prevent any

107
00:08:48,031 --> 00:08:52,927
dust another land and turning the machine if you have a model that's a bit more

108
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:57,567
like that's the final thing to mention is that there is a little through at the

109
00:08:57,632 --> 00:09:02,911
top which you can use to adjust the press of it so you can receive just

110
00:09:02,943 --> 00:09:07,807
attending how fine or thick your fabric is that could also help with your machine and

111
00:09:08,159 --> 00:09:12,351
I think it's definitely worth highlighting that I've done a video recently help the same a

112
00:09:12,383 --> 00:09:18,495
locker and in that video I discussed how I wanted to change the blade and it

113
00:09:18,559 --> 00:09:23,807
turned out that one of the overlock obliques Cruz was really jammed it was the lower

114
00:09:23,872 --> 00:09:29,312
blade and and this obviously was an idea what I had to take it to him

115
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:33,823
somewhere to get it repaired and for them to at the new blade they did say

116
00:09:33,919 --> 00:09:39,903
this and the course for it was because it's not a brilliant quality machine and so

117
00:09:40,383 --> 00:09:43,583
I mean that could be because it's a budget machine it could be that this particular

118
00:09:43,679 --> 00:09:48,031
model by fluke had a fault it's one of those things where I receive board it

119
00:09:48,096 --> 00:09:53,119
years ago I'd never changed the blade which is quite chainfall really considering how you used

120
00:09:53,151 --> 00:09:57,632
it and how much fabric or probably cut with the original plates but yes something that

121
00:09:57,695 --> 00:09:59,711
obviously wasn't identified during its warrantee

122
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:05,088
so I probably would recommend if you do get any blocker to check how long the

123
00:10:05,151 --> 00:10:09,247
warranty is perhaps try changing the plates before the end of the warranting just in case

124
00:10:09,312 --> 00:10:14,047
you have an issue like my does because at least then you can get someone to

125
00:10:14,176 --> 00:10:17,728
repair it for you are from that I don't really had any huge issues with it

126
00:10:18,239 --> 00:10:22,239
like I say it's complete game changer at the time I definitely wouldn't have been in

127
00:10:22,304 --> 00:10:28,575
a position to buy a much more expensive overlocker so this really suited my budget it

128
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:34,400
suited the purpose I wouldn't really dissuade someone necessarily from a budget machine like this and

129
00:10:34,495 --> 00:10:41,119
some people I know with some possibly even cheap models in this have had issues with

130
00:10:41,247 --> 00:10:46,719
threading I'm on the quality of the stitching but sometimes that is due to the threat

131
00:10:47,328 --> 00:10:51,583
that you're using so it's always good to get a bit like with this ocean get

132
00:10:51,679 --> 00:10:56,607
good quality through us it's much more likely to be through better and so that's always

133
00:10:56,831 --> 00:11:03,744
worth checking before you discard the whole machine it is obviously great if you can try

134
00:11:03,903 --> 00:11:09,151
out the machine before this is the sort of machine that isn't necessarily going to be

135
00:11:09,280 --> 00:11:12,000
enough in a showroom place where you can try to pull by

136
00:11:13,504 --> 00:11:17,567
but obviously you do get a warrant till you know you get some protection as a

137
00:11:17,952 --> 00:11:24,000
purchaser so obviously do give it a good test want to and much of that and

138
00:11:24,031 --> 00:11:27,328
that at least you can find out whether it works for you but I would definitely

139
00:11:27,968 --> 00:11:32,640
make sure that the to do got up to scratch and yeah you've just got to

140
00:11:32,671 --> 00:11:36,960
be really patient with running Lacan's as well how once you have got the tension so

141
00:11:37,056 --> 00:11:43,872
it is and it works swimmingly and it really does speed up and it can really

142
00:11:44,192 --> 00:11:48,927
produce a professional finish I would still recommend that argosy if you do have more money

143
00:11:49,088 --> 00:11:53,632
why not go for a better model if you know you're willing to spend that that's

144
00:11:53,728 --> 00:11:56,640
it the this time oversee if you do what we say and training all these how

145
00:11:56,736 --> 00:12:01,280
about this particular model let me know and I'm trying to help out with that and

146
00:12:01,343 --> 00:12:05,760
such as shown in some of the different stitches you can use how you adjust attention

147
00:12:06,687 --> 00:12:08,768
or I can just simply show how you surround the machine

148
00:12:10,143 --> 00:12:12,768
but yeah that's it to this time thanks for watching
