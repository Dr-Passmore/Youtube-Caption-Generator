00:00:01,120 --> 00:00:06,239
now today's video is going to be slightly different Phyllis going to be leading on the

1
00:00:06,303 --> 00:00:11,263
video as he's going to be talking about a recent project he's just completed

2
00:00:16,063 --> 00:00:21,184
this is related to use your stuff and one of the challenges you've had is so

3
00:00:21,408 --> 00:00:22,656
film in what the down

4
00:00:23,936 --> 00:00:28,159
at the moment we have a tripod soft hasn't the banished and we do so

5
00:00:32,799 --> 00:00:37,119
it's fairly good on what it does it's quite hard to get to it and the

6
00:00:37,183 --> 00:00:41,759
reason I use the window so it's because this is actually a really tiny romance that

7
00:00:42,015 --> 00:00:47,231
smallest Romanov that and I used to have only other side of the table when sometimes

8
00:00:47,296 --> 00:00:50,464
I still do but it does mean that it's a bit harder to get in and

9
00:00:50,527 --> 00:00:54,944
out of the room it is the doors for that no the camera their camera here

10
00:00:55,967 --> 00:01:00,256
a few steps around him like some things yes you quite limited space to work or

11
00:01:00,863 --> 00:01:07,807
exactly and also with I'm working from home it's been a bit more challenging to set

12
00:01:07,903 --> 00:01:13,599
up for doing certain videos particularly ones where I'm trying to show you what I'm doing

13
00:01:13,952 --> 00:01:16,255
and such as tutorials and

14
00:01:17,311 --> 00:01:20,064
I just don't be easier if we had something that was a bit more out of

15
00:01:20,127 --> 00:01:24,639
the way and slightly more prevalent as well because obviously I can't always I do actually

16
00:01:24,704 --> 00:01:29,375
end up leaving the triple that law that obviously it's really hard to clean the windowsill

17
00:01:29,823 --> 00:01:34,304
is hard to open a close the window it's hard to open place the blind and

18
00:01:34,463 --> 00:01:36,832
say yeah there's all sorts of issues with her

19
00:01:38,431 --> 00:01:39,232
so that's the solution

20
00:01:40,319 --> 00:01:44,575
we will consider unpaying something want to receive it and one of things I do have

21
00:01:44,639 --> 00:01:48,255
line around its marble or ask me pass so I'm really it as we pay it

22
00:01:48,288 --> 00:01:49,024
is a computer

23
00:01:50,527 --> 00:01:53,984
normally mmf besides that a credit card this is a high zero so it seems small

24
00:01:54,047 --> 00:01:59,424
turn and what I've done is attached a camera module to it and a small case

25
00:02:00,096 --> 00:02:02,559
of again to fit it to the scene and so it was nice walk down to

26
00:02:02,592 --> 00:02:03,167
you on the table

27
00:02:04,192 --> 00:02:07,776
I haven't actually worked out how we're going to fix it to the ceiling the next

28
00:02:11,136 --> 00:02:16,192
say I mean it's one thing to mention is that it is really light so it's

29
00:02:16,287 --> 00:02:21,472
not going to be a huge issue working out how to attach it but it still

30
00:02:21,535 --> 00:02:26,591
will be something to think about to cheat project as well as replies sell for things

31
00:02:26,815 --> 00:02:27,904
that he could for prices

32
00:02:28,927 --> 00:02:30,623
but again I got that sit around for about a year

33
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:33,055
not really don't much

34
00:02:35,007 --> 00:02:35,360
project

35
00:02:37,951 --> 00:02:44,479
really know it has discomfits quite it's quite low-powered and my grassy pie three was just

36
00:02:44,511 --> 00:02:48,287
a family but library high holger's never quite unblock in

37
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:51,647
until you suffer round with high three for quite a lot

38
00:02:52,735 --> 00:02:56,671
but this is very specific use case in it this is perfect for really deep but

39
00:02:56,768 --> 00:02:58,175
I'm not raining if that makes

40
00:02:59,296 --> 00:03:04,703
me think it easefully and this is accessible by a web browser

41
00:03:06,367 --> 00:03:08,671
on any you're connected to our own little network

42
00:03:09,888 --> 00:03:14,432
which means advantage to this is curry just needs to go on to any computer even

43
00:03:14,496 --> 00:03:19,583
a think and it hit to start the course gismos options use take pictures you can

44
00:03:19,615 --> 00:03:21,408
record video you do time lapse

45
00:03:22,432 --> 00:03:25,919
the software we use in actually can be used for a ratty thing so too can

46
00:03:25,951 --> 00:03:29,856
stuff like commission sensors so any records from the text mission which is the news for

47
00:03:29,919 --> 00:03:32,800
us but so are very scared to come for example perfect

48
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:37,632
play ideally this will replace our parent tribals

49
00:03:38,815 --> 00:03:43,904
approach this will just civil singing either by folks I'm not so we could probably have

50
00:03:43,968 --> 00:03:46,048
it speed work or how far down that needs to be is

51
00:03:47,712 --> 00:03:51,520
so we haven't actually tried what it looks like a play out its kind of being

52
00:03:51,583 --> 00:03:56,863
sitting in our lounge while he's been testing it and but yes we want it up

53
00:03:56,927 --> 00:04:00,511
there but we do have a light fitting up there as well someone to make sure

54
00:04:00,544 --> 00:04:05,055
that that's not in short obviously I could assume in when I edit the footage but

55
00:04:05,119 --> 00:04:09,503
I'd have to remember doing that every time and also it will reduce the quality because

56
00:04:09,567 --> 00:04:14,464
the more easy him in the more picks laces and blood the quality is well they

57
00:04:14,591 --> 00:04:19,679
say that along this I will just speed up or these the time lapse function because

58
00:04:19,743 --> 00:04:24,127
it we really useful to those bits when I am just I'm cutting something out because

59
00:04:24,191 --> 00:04:28,447
ever see it's quite boring to watch someone cut or hand say something in real time

60
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:33,023
it's the law it's a lot I'm more effective to speed up the footage which is

61
00:04:33,088 --> 00:04:37,791
obviously what I've done in many videos before now so he was just makes it easier

62
00:04:38,015 --> 00:04:43,359
the advantage of using this is that it gets saved direct on to the server the

63
00:04:43,424 --> 00:04:47,648
difference so if I use my camcorder or my de SLR I have to save the

64
00:04:47,712 --> 00:04:52,608
footage and also with my DSL a it can only say it can only am record

65
00:04:52,671 --> 00:04:55,967
up to thirty minutes it's only twenty thirty minutes at a time so then you have

66
00:04:56,032 --> 00:05:00,575
to stop and start it again whereas obviously if I'm koshering something I could be sitting

67
00:05:00,671 --> 00:05:04,608
down for a long time so it would be quite gets have something that will just

68
00:05:04,799 --> 00:05:12,223
enjoy being switched on and reporting that potentially hours well yes so really invitation we had

69
00:05:12,256 --> 00:05:17,536
with this is tequilas the video files it saves to empty for but does this locally

70
00:05:18,592 --> 00:05:22,944
which essentially means it needs some memory on here I'm it save simply fall straight to

71
00:05:22,976 --> 00:05:27,135
the server so they can be to the of this really quickly afterwards and I've begun

72
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:28,127
by for web browsers well

73
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:33,600
but does mean that one thing to write it up is I'm gonna have to clone

74
00:05:33,888 --> 00:05:38,175
the SD card this was the memory on the swings of his nasty glance

75
00:05:39,328 --> 00:05:43,903
I am Guinness converse and this is a sixteen gigabyte SD card not just off and

76
00:05:43,936 --> 00:05:49,920
rich went shaking out the ovens and twenty eight gigabytes will be fine is only a

77
00:05:49,984 --> 00:05:54,528
lot of a lot of devices called take much more than that that someone that's kind

78
00:05:54,559 --> 00:05:59,679
of the limit at the moment and oversee that's quite a good budget capacity as well

79
00:05:59,743 --> 00:06:03,679
as though you know done the cost too much at that storage level I run the

80
00:06:03,743 --> 00:06:08,096
numbers of to nati piece of switch your looking about to answer for recording time yeah

81
00:06:08,223 --> 00:06:14,816
we don't believe I probably wouldn't be there listing for more than twelve hours straight sometimes

82
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:18,175
I do leave them they can call it what it up on that try but I

83
00:06:18,272 --> 00:06:23,328
do leave out running because it is quite hard to get to the stop-start button and

84
00:06:23,391 --> 00:06:29,055
so I will just leave it running sometimes obviously twelve hours of crafting in the day

85
00:06:29,279 --> 00:06:33,696
is by a lot I mean I probably do that some days but to yeah yeah

86
00:06:33,791 --> 00:06:37,536
tonight's being quite following were just like with he stopped to do this video but I'm

87
00:06:37,567 --> 00:06:42,720
ready to carry on since the other will be I'm a video of me re-covering the

88
00:06:42,783 --> 00:06:47,743
puffy but there's an awful lot footage because I managed to fill up one and memory

89
00:06:47,808 --> 00:06:53,631
cuts completely and I'm not really sure why I guess my disallows higher quality for that

90
00:06:53,696 --> 00:06:54,911
is high quality yeah

91
00:07:00,671 --> 00:07:04,608
so it's very gonna save me a while to edit it over repeat this week or

92
00:07:04,671 --> 00:07:09,247
next week maybe the week after maybe in a couple weeks and so yes so that

93
00:07:09,312 --> 00:07:16,096
won't feature this particular camera which is a shame but I'm really excited that we have

94
00:07:16,191 --> 00:07:19,712
rollable rolling with this is when but she talked about it for a while and I

95
00:07:19,776 --> 00:07:27,295
think when I first voiced the frustration with the current setup and what I'd ideally like

96
00:07:28,063 --> 00:07:32,032
I don't think you were a place with your playing around with Ross replies that you

97
00:07:32,096 --> 00:07:36,415
would about confident to do different time is done to me I mean that took me

98
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:40,575
warm three for us to trouble cheeks as it wasn't saving broke me and it was

99
00:07:40,704 --> 00:07:45,951
a and say she's a she meant roughly a good day and you know building it

100
00:07:46,976 --> 00:07:52,992
setting up just and testing it and I'm saying a daily see like maybe twice you

101
00:07:53,055 --> 00:07:53,600
know social

102
00:07:54,847 --> 00:07:57,664
you started yesterday and you have finished today

103
00:07:58,752 --> 00:07:58,944
and

104
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:04,895
yes they I'm not actually sure when we will start using it properly in its final

105
00:08:04,928 --> 00:08:09,343
destination Billy soon we will get that set up but it was been a bit different

106
00:08:09,376 --> 00:08:14,496
Ficino's into the genus yeah so um yeah received you know someone he's into

107
00:08:15,584 --> 00:08:16,799
but what what would you call this hobby

108
00:08:18,303 --> 00:08:23,584
tech okay if you know someone whose into tech and can do this sort of thing

109
00:08:24,287 --> 00:08:29,247
honestly it's very useful and but you can say uses you said the security cameras yes

110
00:08:29,855 --> 00:08:33,791
I'm and also is it like if you wanted to be a wildlife camera you can

111
00:08:33,856 --> 00:08:37,919
be things all the what did you can put it so that and it's a tax

112
00:08:37,984 --> 00:08:43,840
emotions are only records when the sensor yeah notes to something meeting there's a Thomas sentence

113
00:08:43,903 --> 00:08:46,687
on this will software we use which was just Nagant use from this case

114
00:08:47,776 --> 00:08:52,320
you can set times on sometimes they saw not work you can set it to second-nature

115
00:08:52,383 --> 00:08:52,895
the record

116
00:08:54,559 --> 00:08:55,520
as nice time and date so

117
00:08:57,343 --> 00:08:58,624
tragically on this default

118
00:08:59,776 --> 00:09:02,528
of course moved the Trussell the first record is

119
00:09:09,664 --> 00:09:14,752
right so that's it for this week oversee will be back with another video next week

120
00:09:14,911 --> 00:09:19,104
possibly a catch up not shall have to see what about she's done in the last

121
00:09:19,135 --> 00:09:24,127
month well done you you like us is ripe for more rapid high content

122
00:09:26,463 --> 00:09:32,031
so I was about yes I'm happy if you gonna create more technology that can make

123
00:09:32,127 --> 00:09:35,455
my life easier than to the document my make small that's brilliant
