hello in this video I will show you how Phil and I made a light up

1
00:00:03,871 --> 00:00:07,840
bookmark for my niece the bookmark has a simple castle design on the spur of a

2
00:00:07,903 --> 00:00:12,479
hill with the moon overhead the castle windows light up if you press down on the

3
00:00:12,543 --> 00:00:16,416
moon so first I will show you the tools I used for this project I have

4
00:00:16,479 --> 00:00:20,416
a print out of my bookmark design I ended up during a final version on the

5
00:00:20,447 --> 00:00:24,639
computer but I began with a sketch and if you plan to do this yourself you

6
00:00:24,767 --> 00:00:26,687
could certainly just create it from a drawing

7
00:00:27,903 --> 00:00:33,855
next we have a lilypad a sewing prototype this has a battery section a button a

8
00:00:33,919 --> 00:00:39,807
separate switch and three led lights we ended up using all three ladies the button and

9
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:44,032
the battery section we did not use the separate switch I have a small piece of

10
00:00:44,159 --> 00:00:48,223
lutra door you can get different thicknesses of leech door but I went for the thick

11
00:00:48,319 --> 00:00:52,895
of variety you can see that I have already traced the design phase next there is

12
00:00:52,959 --> 00:00:56,639
a glow in the dark paint for the mean not essential but I thought it would

13
00:00:56,736 --> 00:01:00,448
add a nice extra touch I've got to a range of paint brushes and fabric paints

14
00:01:00,672 --> 00:01:05,279
for creating the footpath grass and sky a jar which I will fill with water to

15
00:01:05,344 --> 00:01:09,823
clean my brushes when required a set of intense blocks which can be used on textiles

16
00:01:09,984 --> 00:01:14,335
just because these provide a worried a variety of colors than the dialogue paints I've got

17
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:18,015
there there's a small piece of warding to pad out the inside of the bookmark a

18
00:01:18,111 --> 00:01:22,080
piece of black felt for the back of the bookmark and the bobbin of conductive thread

19
00:01:22,176 --> 00:01:25,216
silicon stitch a circuit as well as scissors and a needle

20
00:01:26,272 --> 00:01:31,776
other items I used included the sewing machine the embroidery foot on the sewing machine because

21
00:01:31,839 --> 00:01:36,447
I did some free machine and broidery for this and relevant sewing threads for the design

22
00:01:36,736 --> 00:01:40,959
I used a snap faster as well from my set and a green one in this

23
00:01:41,055 --> 00:01:45,727
case so that it matched the grass section as it was at the base of the

24
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:52,127
bookmark first I began painting the little I started to mix the dialogue paints to create

25
00:01:52,223 --> 00:01:56,608
a shade for the footpath but ended up using the color blocks to create it with

26
00:01:56,736 --> 00:01:59,968
these color blocks you can use waters to spread and blend the color

27
00:02:24,703 --> 00:02:29,248
the great thing about them is that you can mix the different shapes and in the

28
00:02:29,343 --> 00:02:34,304
set and it just adds a bit more texture and depth like I'm doing here for

29
00:02:34,367 --> 00:02:38,527
the grass area again you can use some water to blend the shades together

30
00:03:01,695 --> 00:03:03,391
I use the dialogue paint for the sky

31
00:03:04,544 --> 00:03:09,248
you could of course lay of fabrics using a plicae for achieving the different elements of

32
00:03:09,311 --> 00:03:13,919
the scenery if you don't have any lutra door fabric paints and but I just decide

33
00:03:13,951 --> 00:03:16,063
to sit this way because I did have the tools

34
00:03:35,679 --> 00:03:40,000
you could wait until the colors of dried before adding the clone the dark paint and

35
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:44,384
I probably would recommend doing that but I was quite eager to carry on so I

36
00:03:44,544 --> 00:03:49,184
started adding the glow in the dark paint to the moon straight away and just that

37
00:03:49,248 --> 00:03:50,688
it could all dry at the same time

38
00:03:51,776 --> 00:03:56,416
once try I headed over to the sewing machine to machine and broader the castle silhouette

39
00:03:56,608 --> 00:03:57,567
onto the lutra door

40
00:03:58,656 --> 00:04:03,455
again this is another case where you could have plica the castle design but I went

41
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:08,160
for machine embroidery to ensure that there was a thick enough layer in place so that

42
00:04:08,223 --> 00:04:10,944
the lead is only shone through the windows and the design

43
00:04:12,447 --> 00:04:16,735
also due to the size it might be quite tricky to a plicae however you probably

44
00:04:16,799 --> 00:04:21,536
could use something like black felt and just glue it in place

45
00:04:23,071 --> 00:04:27,455
leech star is great for machine embroidery as it's such a stable material so if you

46
00:04:27,519 --> 00:04:32,223
did want to go down the free machine embroidery roots I deadly recommend picking up some

47
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:32,768
later it off

48
00:05:01,023 --> 00:05:05,279
I decided that the footpath moon and top of the held needed a bit more definition

49
00:05:05,471 --> 00:05:10,847
so I just added a simple bit of stitching to add a bit more definition using

50
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:11,872
appropriate colors

51
00:05:41,503 --> 00:05:45,536
next I had to work out where to place the battery section you can see on

52
00:05:45,567 --> 00:05:49,376
my design that I've added a square for the battery location towards the bottom of the

53
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:54,368
bookmark I wanted to leave the boss image open at which would be sold by a

54
00:05:54,463 --> 00:05:58,015
snap fastener in order to allow the coin battery to be changed

55
00:06:01,119 --> 00:06:05,343
once I decided on the position I removed the warding from this section as well as

56
00:06:05,407 --> 00:06:07,743
the section below so that the battery was accessible

57
00:06:12,287 --> 00:06:14,783
I tried to the front peace down to its final size

58
00:06:16,511 --> 00:06:20,063
and then worked out where the three led's and the buttons which would go

59
00:06:21,279 --> 00:06:25,951
now here's failed to explain the circuit used for the bookmark thanks go this is a

60
00:06:26,015 --> 00:06:33,503
simple parallel circuit the battery is Peredur three Elodie's to complete the circuit the button is

61
00:06:33,631 --> 00:06:39,007
pushed when it's pressed down the Elodie's light up to create the circuit I stitched the

62
00:06:39,071 --> 00:06:44,096
conductive thread to the positive section on the battery board and then did a simple running

63
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:49,696
stitch through the warding and black felt up to where the first lead would be situated

64
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:50,175
in the middle

65
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:10,048
I secured the plus section on the first led into place by stitching it down a

66
00:07:10,111 --> 00:07:13,855
few times and then cussing the thread once knotted

67
00:07:15,071 --> 00:07:17,727
I then went back to secure the battery side with the not

68
00:07:24,768 --> 00:07:28,032
next I stitched the positive side of the next lead

69
00:07:29,152 --> 00:07:33,376
for this one it needed to connect up to the original line of thread which connected

70
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:39,071
my original line of stitching that linked back to the battery positive light

71
00:07:48,735 --> 00:07:52,287
you can see her that I secured it and then cut the thread but I could

72
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:57,247
have continued stitching to secure the third lead on the other side which would have saved

73
00:07:57,279 --> 00:07:59,391
a bit of contractive threads as well as time

74
00:08:45,856 --> 00:08:51,200
to ensure the allies have been connected correctly feel used a wire to test the circuit

75
00:08:51,392 --> 00:08:56,383
to complete the other section as you can see by the sped up blinking lights this

76
00:08:56,479 --> 00:09:00,416
test proof that the statue was fine however it's a good test to do at this

77
00:09:00,447 --> 00:09:04,768
stage to save you time having to unpick your work at a later point if it's

78
00:09:04,864 --> 00:09:05,823
not working correctly

79
00:09:09,023 --> 00:09:12,831
to connect the top of the led's together you can see that I have done it

80
00:09:12,895 --> 00:09:16,992
the way that I described earlier I've created a running stitch between the right and left

81
00:09:17,216 --> 00:09:21,664
led's and then created a new line of running stitch from the center lead which I

82
00:09:21,823 --> 00:09:24,479
secured to the other line of stitching to connect them together

83
00:09:26,463 --> 00:09:29,823
the side of the led's are all negative connections on this end

84
00:09:32,127 --> 00:09:35,776
next I worked out the location of the push button which would be placed under the

85
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:41,471
moon I continued that line of running stitch right up to one of the connectors on

86
00:09:41,536 --> 00:09:47,104
the push button and knotted it led to secure the pushbutton doesn't have positive or negative

87
00:09:47,168 --> 00:09:50,880
connections on either side so you can connect which I decide you want first

88
00:09:52,096 --> 00:09:56,703
I then start a new piece of conducted thread secured it to the other connection on

89
00:09:56,768 --> 00:10:01,023
the other side of the push button then I made a running stitch that went all

90
00:10:01,056 --> 00:10:05,408
the way from this point right back down to one of the negative connections on the

91
00:10:05,471 --> 00:10:12,512
battery section making sure that I avoided any of my earlier stitching to avoid short-circuiting the

92
00:10:12,575 --> 00:10:18,271
circuits and ensuring that the stitching remained within the constraints of the bookmark size

93
00:10:19,359 --> 00:10:21,504
once again I secured it with the not

94
00:10:30,463 --> 00:10:33,856
I popped the front of the book mark over the top and tested the light layout

95
00:10:34,208 --> 00:10:35,424
and that the pushbutton white

96
00:10:44,192 --> 00:10:48,159
next I used my rotary caster's to trim down the warding and the felt backing

97
00:10:53,408 --> 00:10:55,968
I pin three sections together ready for sewing

98
00:11:03,007 --> 00:11:08,864
I took some fairly neutrals red and began to stitch around one side the top and

99
00:11:08,895 --> 00:11:12,127
then the other side leaving the base of the bookmark paper

100
00:12:22,239 --> 00:12:26,432
then did a further trim with some scissors to nice enough the bookmark at the fort

101
00:12:30,463 --> 00:12:34,943
I tested it once more to check that and accidentally cut the circuit threads and then

102
00:12:35,072 --> 00:12:36,799
moved on to securing the base

103
00:12:41,312 --> 00:12:45,632
I used to snap fastener kiss but you could use a regular proper if preferred

104
00:12:46,656 --> 00:12:50,656
the kick came with an all which is great for marking the two sides of the

105
00:12:50,752 --> 00:12:53,760
fastener on both sides so that it matches up nicely

106
00:13:06,432 --> 00:13:10,463
and there you have it one completed light up castle bookmark
