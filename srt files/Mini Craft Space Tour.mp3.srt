00:00:01,407 --> 00:00:06,688
now today is a quick video I thought I'd show you my rejig of the craft

1
00:00:06,751 --> 00:00:12,128
room so at work I got this desk chair which is brilliant so I did one

2
00:00:12,192 --> 00:00:17,920
of those to the display screen equipment assessment I'm as I hadn't done one instance I'm

3
00:00:18,016 --> 00:00:24,511
working remote leader I am during this current pandemic and yeah the response was my place

4
00:00:24,576 --> 00:00:29,312
of work anyway Oh in either nuchae will send you on which was brilliant and the

5
00:00:29,375 --> 00:00:33,919
main problem with that obviously was that this room isn't huge and I do share it

6
00:00:33,951 --> 00:00:37,279
with my partner fell and saying he's got desk over there but I won't shoot her

7
00:00:37,344 --> 00:00:42,591
because it's a complete mess and snakes cleaning up but the rest of the rumors but

8
00:00:42,655 --> 00:00:48,416
on the microbe an area but gusli it's all so now and my work and space

9
00:00:48,543 --> 00:00:52,352
as well and it does it be work full time I'm using during the week days

10
00:00:52,479 --> 00:00:56,512
for don't leave for work so yeah I just thought I'd share this space with you

11
00:00:56,576 --> 00:01:02,015
today so at the moment by me I've got my sewing machine space sat up for

12
00:01:02,080 --> 00:01:07,903
doing my hundred-day projects so today I've got a llama to stitch so I'll be setting

13
00:01:08,031 --> 00:01:13,888
us up shortly yet so I've got to studio like to so I recently got these

14
00:01:14,111 --> 00:01:19,711
led lights which or ever seeing a lot more compact and the big and that furtively

15
00:01:19,839 --> 00:01:25,087
much cheaper and studio lights that kind of a the like a big which you can

16
00:01:25,311 --> 00:01:30,944
like a big umbrella slow and and they've got the much larger bones in the side

17
00:01:31,839 --> 00:01:35,136
and so this setup works a lot better in this space

18
00:01:37,311 --> 00:01:42,847
so I've moved my dress form tucked away in the corner and and this just works

19
00:01:42,879 --> 00:01:48,000
a lot better because we tend to Pompeian to the transform a lot of always intended

20
00:01:48,991 --> 00:01:52,767
I used to store it right by the doorway which oversee was a brilliant so it's

21
00:01:52,863 --> 00:01:56,255
a lot saying for that this table that I've got my sewing machine on is a

22
00:01:56,384 --> 00:02:00,959
traditional so machine table and normally I have it so that it's um it's got a

23
00:02:01,152 --> 00:02:07,360
flat so awesome two-thirds of it goes that way and then there's a little ledge on

24
00:02:07,391 --> 00:02:12,192
the other side if you open it out fully and longly I have apparently out to

25
00:02:12,255 --> 00:02:16,544
full capacity but I realized for the persistence of a hundred-day projects I don't actually need

26
00:02:16,639 --> 00:02:21,792
it completely out and it did make that I could put the draft form next to

27
00:02:21,888 --> 00:02:25,695
it and I mean even saying that I can move it slightly out and put it

28
00:02:26,111 --> 00:02:31,264
expanded fully if I wanted to use it and with this layout but obviously I don't

29
00:02:31,391 --> 00:02:36,544
need to most the time so I've compacted that there for now so the glass table

30
00:02:36,703 --> 00:02:41,695
has been moved over to the corner of the rooms originally I had my computer workstation

31
00:02:41,856 --> 00:02:45,759
in the corner of the room however I bit the glass table there now this is

32
00:02:45,856 --> 00:02:50,304
because I needed enough space for this desk chair to be able to actually sit in

33
00:02:50,367 --> 00:02:53,024
front of the computer vexation and it couldn't

34
00:02:54,304 --> 00:03:00,000
slop down the side between the glass table and when the workstation was and because it

35
00:03:00,031 --> 00:03:05,983
was right next to the wall stay underneath the last table of but what's called the

36
00:03:06,016 --> 00:03:10,335
sonnet table and he was from a cafe and somewhere else sweets to live that we

37
00:03:10,432 --> 00:03:16,063
bought the number of years ago now probably about eight years ago and it's just an

38
00:03:16,128 --> 00:03:20,735
old ikea table it's too combined together but the bottom one had the legs hacked off

39
00:03:21,792 --> 00:03:27,104
and I'm we were going to get rid of it but it is the only thing

40
00:03:27,199 --> 00:03:30,815
I have available that the cover stitch machine will find out and because the come a

41
00:03:30,848 --> 00:03:34,623
stitch machine is massive and there's no house to put out the moment so

42
00:03:35,712 --> 00:03:39,391
we've kept the solid table for now I'm I do love the solid table but it

43
00:03:39,423 --> 00:03:44,447
just doesn't fit in our living area which is the same but it is just too

44
00:03:44,511 --> 00:03:44,992
big for us

45
00:03:46,272 --> 00:03:52,128
I've got one of those homograft trollies and that's really useful to hold all of the

46
00:03:52,192 --> 00:03:58,432
different threats I've got some other nations and haberdashery it's also got the odd bit of

47
00:03:58,464 --> 00:04:03,744
fabric on there as well finally I've got my new computer don't man so and this

48
00:04:03,936 --> 00:04:09,248
tower is what they've been working on over the last day or so so he decided

49
00:04:09,311 --> 00:04:14,432
that I needed an upgrade because I think my laptop was getting all of it in

50
00:04:14,496 --> 00:04:20,544
years and he felt that it wasn't after the challenge of editing of these videos so

51
00:04:21,119 --> 00:04:26,623
he's created a speck which apparently will make this a lot easier to do

52
00:04:27,712 --> 00:04:32,287
and then yes so next to the tower is my computer workstation and so it's quite

53
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:37,247
small I'm to be honest I didn't purchase it with the idea I'd be working

54
00:04:38,752 --> 00:04:42,528
home of my hours from home so it was just more about and I'm just gonna

55
00:04:42,559 --> 00:04:46,911
use of the odd creative project and then I'm not actually going to even switch on

56
00:04:46,976 --> 00:04:51,776
my Qaboos and most things but I'm obviously now the situation is quite different and even

57
00:04:51,808 --> 00:04:56,415
moving forwards I think there's gonna be a lot more homeworking then they would have been

58
00:04:56,480 --> 00:05:02,752
in my dog so that's why spoke that's pretty much ever this week so not an

59
00:05:02,911 --> 00:05:07,776
awful lot of sounds being going on since I finished my dress last weekend I do

60
00:05:07,936 --> 00:05:12,480
have some fabric dying I'm hoping to do I'm probably tomorrow now because it's quite late

61
00:05:12,511 --> 00:05:16,320
in the day and I still need to do my hundred-day projects and oversee edit this

62
00:05:16,544 --> 00:05:21,440
and the hundred-day project video another reason I haven't got on with an awful aircraft recently

63
00:05:21,536 --> 00:05:25,055
is because I have had a bit of a flare up with my chronic bonus so

64
00:05:26,335 --> 00:05:30,847
I found it very challenging to be able to do an awful lot during locked down

65
00:05:30,944 --> 00:05:34,783
I found a quite hard to servant general I'm even though enjoy wifing from home and

66
00:05:34,816 --> 00:05:40,256
to be honest I'm not the most outgoing person anyway so I quite enjoy doing activities

67
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:44,384
around the house and staying in any way I'm but I probably had more of a

68
00:05:44,415 --> 00:05:49,247
preference towards yon based projects that have been doing local of war listing and and a

69
00:05:49,279 --> 00:05:54,239
mansion finished placed my I'm make time projects for the sheer which are young best which

70
00:05:54,368 --> 00:06:00,575
I don't know leading that even listening I found really challenging to compare at the moment

71
00:06:00,735 --> 00:06:03,328
I've just been frotting an awful lot

72
00:06:05,567 --> 00:06:10,816
yeah so I think I'm still recovering that from that so having however I'm really pleased

73
00:06:10,847 --> 00:06:15,839
but I managed to get the restoration to reject this room I think there's a lot

74
00:06:15,903 --> 00:06:20,671
more floor space which is probably by an obvious one for us anyway or the layouts

75
00:06:20,864 --> 00:06:25,984
a bit more practical crusta both working all they say that the computers right in the

76
00:06:26,048 --> 00:06:26,399
door so

77
00:06:27,936 --> 00:06:30,656
it doesn't leave much of an entrance into the room

78
00:06:31,903 --> 00:06:35,936
it's going to mean that my videos will have a slightly different approach because I used

79
00:06:35,967 --> 00:06:41,503
to piss and this camera one side of the last table and then I'd sit behind

80
00:06:41,567 --> 00:06:45,119
it obviously with this layer I want you have to do that I might just do

81
00:06:45,664 --> 00:06:49,824
a few more videos where if I'm showing it to to real or time last to

82
00:06:49,888 --> 00:06:53,631
something I'm doing I might just do it over head shots instead say I think that's

83
00:06:53,696 --> 00:06:58,048
it for this time I'm not sure what I'm going to be reporting next week color

84
00:06:58,239 --> 00:07:03,104
of got the motivation to complete something I really need to do some hand dying actually

85
00:07:03,231 --> 00:07:09,183
say that might reach up and although might be a tutorial I'm not completely sure thanks

86
00:07:09,216 --> 00:07:09,664
for watching
