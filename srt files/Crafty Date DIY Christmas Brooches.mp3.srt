00:00:00,256 --> 00:00:00,607
welcome

1
00:00:02,496 --> 00:00:06,047
hello today we're going to show you how to make your own Christmas breach like so

2
00:00:08,288 --> 00:00:13,376
it's also our second crafty date so we did one last year when we did needle

3
00:00:13,439 --> 00:00:18,464
felt and bears which took absolutely hours so we thought we'd go for a bit of

4
00:00:18,496 --> 00:00:21,568
a quicker one this year because it seems to be an annual thing at the moment

5
00:00:21,888 --> 00:00:27,488
and Christmas think she was a crystal hopefully but will sleep because I kind of locked

6
00:00:27,583 --> 00:00:31,392
up this tutorial and the last time we use the natural kit that we got from

7
00:00:31,423 --> 00:00:37,439
hobby craft this time I've made something up so this will happily be a template which

8
00:00:37,472 --> 00:00:42,527
you can download from my website so you'll be completely from and then you can either

9
00:00:42,591 --> 00:00:47,040
follow along with the video or I try and give some really simple directions on the

10
00:00:47,071 --> 00:00:52,672
website in a bog placed so today we're making some Christmas themes breeches so I've just

11
00:00:52,703 --> 00:00:56,416
done to designed for now I do have other riders in my head a bit just

12
00:00:56,799 --> 00:01:00,383
something like some simple issue so see you we've got a Christmas Google that you can

13
00:01:00,448 --> 00:01:03,327
make and so this would just be you know you can pin it on to your

14
00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:06,335
told Paul your bag just just a little mini festive

15
00:01:07,711 --> 00:01:12,223
embellishment and there's also a Christmas looking breach I guess it's one of those things you

16
00:01:12,255 --> 00:01:16,351
know might get they lost on the top like feels wearing today but you know if

17
00:01:16,384 --> 00:01:19,872
you work sunlight it like those place to work where they don't want you to be

18
00:01:19,935 --> 00:01:24,031
too fast of at work we could probably get away with a little fragile brooch which

19
00:01:24,896 --> 00:01:28,319
had the little marker of Christmas is coming but you know it they weren't quite ready

20
00:01:28,543 --> 00:01:31,776
for folds the jump or the other day that's just let's just put it that way

21
00:01:32,223 --> 00:01:35,935
and told him he was too early and you can only why our own Christmas trumpety

22
00:01:36,255 --> 00:01:39,680
this is another which is a resealing one day in the year which is a bit

23
00:01:39,744 --> 00:01:41,952
of a waste of you forget

24
00:01:43,615 --> 00:01:45,055
what every day to set the

25
00:01:46,912 --> 00:01:50,655
right let's get started so the first we were going to do the prince ah-ah-ah fickle

26
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:52,064
Pete of my lovely template

27
00:01:53,087 --> 00:01:57,055
which designs you want to do you want to the Google all the stocking stock yeah

28
00:01:57,440 --> 00:02:02,431
okay so the first thing that I'd like you to do is pick out what felt

29
00:02:02,527 --> 00:02:06,944
you want the main bit of the stocking in and then the top bring peace this

30
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:10,207
is my during box in the felt scraps and

31
00:02:11,391 --> 00:02:11,712
pieces

32
00:02:12,992 --> 00:02:16,703
I can't believe I've got this much felt actually I'm surprised okay

33
00:02:18,016 --> 00:02:20,992
what Collins you won't stick of sucking and engineering

34
00:02:22,559 --> 00:02:22,880
sort it

35
00:02:25,472 --> 00:02:27,072
I'll do the other design and

36
00:02:31,712 --> 00:02:32,992
that your and made intension

37
00:02:34,623 --> 00:02:39,520
they will be fast ever know that's why not Suckley yeah maybe all means that and

38
00:02:39,552 --> 00:02:42,944
I need a bit so well my design which you don't seem act of lump-sum top

39
00:02:43,072 --> 00:02:46,944
but you need a little bit for the top of the bubble of you there maybe

40
00:02:47,007 --> 00:02:50,527
I just use a bit white pullup yeah so I mean this step is and slightly

41
00:02:50,623 --> 00:02:55,328
optional but what we're going to do is were actually going to trace out the first

42
00:02:55,391 --> 00:02:57,888
template and all that box was really dirty

43
00:02:58,944 --> 00:03:02,720
and we're going to be the first one on the left each so you're going to

44
00:03:03,264 --> 00:03:09,151
trace out to a pair of these so one this way one in reverse better but

45
00:03:09,216 --> 00:03:14,623
it will be on interfacing so I'm just gonna use some interfacing because it will strengthen

46
00:03:15,871 --> 00:03:19,360
about although saying that I don't know if you really need to use of you probably

47
00:03:19,391 --> 00:03:22,143
could get away with it but it will just help give a bit more structure

48
00:03:23,488 --> 00:03:26,016
yeah and it easier to trace I've got a really to

49
00:03:28,192 --> 00:03:28,863
its basic

50
00:03:30,272 --> 00:03:35,615
so as you shall I show you what to do what I want you here obviously

51
00:03:35,679 --> 00:03:39,839
try to keep your interfacing nicely bolded and then it won't get really Greece like this

52
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:41,472
right so I'm just gonna hold it over

53
00:03:43,455 --> 00:03:44,352
mechanical answer

54
00:03:45,727 --> 00:03:47,199
I'm going to get

55
00:03:49,024 --> 00:03:51,839
there actually with my design it probably doesn't master too much with her

56
00:03:57,408 --> 00:03:59,488
but the designer let's try to the other way because it's

57
00:04:00,544 --> 00:04:04,800
a symmetrical design or oversee or quite match African at one side

58
00:04:06,975 --> 00:04:09,376
you have to the same way I'll just don't cut the

59
00:04:14,207 --> 00:04:18,752
yeah I'm never really sure if anyone knows let me know that within to facing I

60
00:04:18,847 --> 00:04:22,911
just want to sit but blue water that so I basic because I accidentally bought an

61
00:04:23,071 --> 00:04:26,880
extra couple of hers that dress-making scissors when I didn't notice they were right friend took

62
00:04:26,976 --> 00:04:32,160
me once and I'm using like a cheap peril dress-making Sissons to cut this out but

63
00:04:32,223 --> 00:04:35,712
I do sometimes wonder if you're better using regular systems or whether it would want them

64
00:04:35,936 --> 00:04:40,223
so I just need to see you can start to tracing yours so

65
00:04:41,536 --> 00:04:42,432
are you happy with that you

66
00:04:56,768 --> 00:05:00,895
so I put the in spacing as and it's my lovely old and facing so it's

67
00:05:01,536 --> 00:05:06,015
coming away from the city lights on away from the cake side and I'm just going

68
00:05:06,144 --> 00:05:06,239
to

69
00:05:08,256 --> 00:05:10,239
check the interesting and the enticing

70
00:05:12,127 --> 00:05:12,959
basally I'm going to

71
00:05:26,015 --> 00:05:30,015
write so what you're doing that I'm going to I in my not as I'm going

72
00:05:30,079 --> 00:05:34,175
to do some decoration on my Christmas Google just the hands searching before I said that

73
00:05:34,239 --> 00:05:37,727
events together did you want to decorate your stocking it

74
00:05:39,743 --> 00:05:44,127
where you coats were clad beads you could do some random stitching so I might do

75
00:05:44,223 --> 00:05:49,312
some cross-stitch some stitches you could do a line of running stitch

76
00:05:53,631 --> 00:05:59,328
or wandering is making sure the shiny side of my interfacing is facing the out and

77
00:05:59,359 --> 00:06:02,496
then I'm just going to iron this on to the felt pieces

78
00:06:05,791 --> 00:06:15,295
just going to

79
00:06:18,111 --> 00:06:18,911
labor something

80
00:06:20,351 --> 00:06:21,343
to this general election

81
00:06:29,536 --> 00:06:31,872
but the shiny slide down yet yet shiny shut up

82
00:06:34,528 --> 00:06:39,295
yeah so if you just at that right on something I hold it down safe about

83
00:06:39,455 --> 00:06:43,231
eight seconds but it might need more last endings anywhere we have to me that after

84
00:06:43,328 --> 00:06:43,488
that

85
00:06:57,727 --> 00:07:02,687
your custom although and I cut out the top section which is the middle template on

86
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:07,648
the Christmas bawble template and I dressed that one to of it Wanda web

87
00:07:08,832 --> 00:07:13,567
and and I'm just going to attach that to mess around a bit of white folks

88
00:07:13,696 --> 00:07:16,096
for the top I just got to be careful but

89
00:07:17,824 --> 00:07:19,424
as I say this hasn't actually

90
00:07:20,671 --> 00:07:25,023
because my stuff so old good to get it the glue attached to my iron which

91
00:07:25,088 --> 00:07:28,704
will be great see how the wonder what stage is entirely optional so you could tell

92
00:07:28,832 --> 00:07:28,895
us

93
00:07:35,872 --> 00:07:41,152
underwent sticky on both sides so it's got a sticky side what is two layers so

94
00:07:41,216 --> 00:07:45,760
there's a sticky by this quite a demonstration this is a bit it's come away it's

95
00:07:45,791 --> 00:07:50,335
just the sticky Bob which attaches to the belt and this is the paper bet so

96
00:07:50,368 --> 00:07:51,679
you draw wherever you want to

97
00:07:52,864 --> 00:07:57,471
cost that so you can do really accurate looking out on you draw on that section

98
00:07:57,760 --> 00:07:58,432
and then you

99
00:07:59,584 --> 00:08:02,944
cut it out so normally this would be attached together because my Bondo ever so old

100
00:08:03,007 --> 00:08:03,391
it's come away

101
00:08:04,447 --> 00:08:07,903
and you either with the paper side up

102
00:08:09,183 --> 00:08:13,119
and then you cut out the template and then you

103
00:08:14,687 --> 00:08:19,295
here away the paper section and then you attach then you can attach it to another

104
00:08:19,359 --> 00:08:19,839
bit fabric

105
00:08:21,119 --> 00:08:25,152
and then only reinforced with some stitching because it might not stay on this

106
00:08:27,648 --> 00:08:28,832
don't know in on this layer

107
00:08:29,951 --> 00:08:32,640
which is why did the paper for the first time you take it for the first

108
00:08:32,671 --> 00:08:37,408
side and then it should be sandwich between fabric for the second won the bet you've

109
00:08:37,471 --> 00:08:42,176
just you mind so far as the interfacings so that just gives more structures with fabric

110
00:08:42,976 --> 00:08:44,255
so there's only one sticky sighed

111
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:45,599
very

112
00:08:48,096 --> 00:08:51,903
right so the next step for you is to use a bit of my relief bold

113
00:08:54,719 --> 00:08:55,104
really on

114
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:01,599
this is big and affection

115
00:09:07,231 --> 00:09:08,736
with another of this

116
00:09:09,888 --> 00:09:14,719
you can let the trees after that lower down but it all things to

117
00:09:22,495 --> 00:09:28,383
yes if you just want to trace that see if you draw up again yes the

118
00:09:28,447 --> 00:09:29,088
to

119
00:09:31,104 --> 00:09:32,416
stand up

120
00:09:39,520 --> 00:09:43,135
the I'm just going to attach to talk my global so I held the paper they

121
00:09:43,231 --> 00:09:43,711
are my that

122
00:09:47,487 --> 00:09:49,280
yes you have to hold it as she got out

123
00:09:55,263 --> 00:10:06,911
of that the rest sorry if you get like a fresh there when he said

124
00:10:13,408 --> 00:10:16,895
Mike say you don't have to do this you could adjust trace that you know could

125
00:10:16,927 --> 00:10:22,239
have traced the template drawn into felt after and by that it's just I'm just makes

126
00:10:22,271 --> 00:10:23,679
it easier sissy have to stop my not

127
00:10:24,736 --> 00:10:28,031
so it just means that it's not going to move when I had to my decoration

128
00:10:37,695 --> 00:10:42,559
right so you need to say with your contrast fabrics of the Korean superbly up here

129
00:10:42,624 --> 00:10:42,943
somewhere

130
00:10:44,127 --> 00:10:48,416
what I'd recommend it is putting this sphere so if you come over to the iron

131
00:10:56,064 --> 00:10:57,056
and then I'd recommend

132
00:10:58,624 --> 00:10:58,848
so yeah

133
00:11:01,119 --> 00:11:06,400
like station for a farm but saying need that flower savoys it come out the shape

134
00:11:06,463 --> 00:11:06,719
to one

135
00:11:09,088 --> 00:11:13,536
and put that right over the top but the extra cautious with my own they will

136
00:11:13,599 --> 00:11:14,080
be caught of the

137
00:11:15,679 --> 00:11:15,744
yeah

138
00:11:24,031 --> 00:11:28,031
yeah then just again like before just put the eyes on for a few seconds until

139
00:11:28,064 --> 00:11:28,192
it's

140
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:46,687
what you're cutting out and just going to trace the cardboard peace for my one so

141
00:11:46,848 --> 00:11:53,567
just to give it more structure after the interim going to add some cardboards between the

142
00:11:53,599 --> 00:11:55,711
two days just because it is a brooch and

143
00:11:57,375 --> 00:12:00,288
just give him in more structure so I'm just going to

144
00:12:01,567 --> 00:12:05,536
trace around them something on the right so when they got one and card

145
00:12:09,408 --> 00:12:12,736
say you if you were patchy yet we do need the only so if you want

146
00:12:12,768 --> 00:12:15,552
to press that is at the front of your obviously

147
00:12:18,495 --> 00:12:22,143
everyone's you won't press that into the top see I just change whatever when I got

148
00:12:22,208 --> 00:12:23,455
out begun to be the front

149
00:12:27,392 --> 00:12:31,104
yes you now quite that way I've done that many times when I positioned it

150
00:12:32,416 --> 00:12:35,968
just how I wanted it and then realize I left the paper so it wouldn't stick

151
00:12:37,728 --> 00:12:42,463
discretion just one

152
00:12:54,367 --> 00:12:57,312
right so do you want to trace out your the couple with the middle

153
00:12:59,455 --> 00:13:01,952
yeah so can you see through the paper

154
00:13:04,512 --> 00:13:06,080
see if you just done trace around that

155
00:13:08,768 --> 00:13:12,096
that's what I've just done in the speckle about and I've got his a strap in

156
00:13:12,192 --> 00:13:14,143
of powdered I say from the reciting

157
00:13:20,768 --> 00:13:22,848
I guess you could also just got up from this paper

158
00:13:27,935 --> 00:13:28,383
you will

159
00:13:44,064 --> 00:13:48,159
have to go someplace so I just talk my not see him cut out cried not

160
00:13:48,864 --> 00:13:52,351
say what I did what I placed my sampler over a and then drew round up

161
00:13:59,807 --> 00:14:04,416
so obviously you could just make this to make the Christmas decoration c-could stitches to what

162
00:14:04,447 --> 00:14:05,056
together as a

163
00:14:07,776 --> 00:14:10,591
at a bit tearing at the top and then it could be it could be a

164
00:14:10,752 --> 00:14:18,624
Judy decoration Beatrice or anywhere up to a tangled wooden brooch we will need to attach

165
00:14:19,648 --> 00:14:24,416
a brooch piece on the fact so what you will need us to get them back

166
00:14:24,512 --> 00:14:28,383
peace if you're doing a bridge so I got these and have retained

167
00:14:29,504 --> 00:14:31,200
right so you do you want to separate you're so

168
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:33,375
yeah

169
00:14:35,648 --> 00:14:39,392
they're well I'm gonna add some decoration on mine so I'll get this round out as

170
00:14:39,424 --> 00:14:40,320
you'll get to go around your

171
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:46,047
okay so I chose then some orange stars and some white thread from mine so what

172
00:14:46,143 --> 00:14:48,895
I'm going to do is sign the and

173
00:15:09,695 --> 00:15:12,096
the way or used in broideries red is there are six friends

174
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:14,848
in a bit of in the

175
00:15:16,512 --> 00:15:21,280
light so I separate two strands from the rest of the bunch so

176
00:15:24,831 --> 00:15:26,911
why not necessarily x that way of doing it

177
00:15:35,903 --> 00:15:38,656
trying to put my thumb through where I'm dividing

178
00:15:40,895 --> 00:15:52,288
again with the two strands that I've selected I just make sure it's untangled

179
00:15:54,047 --> 00:15:56,031
going to grab the needle

180
00:16:06,559 --> 00:16:09,791
the way of Lanta I don't know this is to do with cross stitch or whoever

181
00:16:09,856 --> 00:16:11,104
taught me but

182
00:16:12,703 --> 00:16:14,495
I get the two ends to meet

183
00:16:16,064 --> 00:16:18,335
and then not in the bottom

184
00:16:20,671 --> 00:16:24,320
right so I've got my from peace and which I need with the added the white

185
00:16:24,416 --> 00:16:27,487
top that of the global elaboration so I'm just going to add

186
00:16:28,703 --> 00:16:29,664
some simple

187
00:16:31,424 --> 00:16:32,351
cross to looking

188
00:16:35,520 --> 00:16:39,679
so what you could do here is you could draw so using

189
00:16:40,927 --> 00:16:43,424
friction pin or you know a

190
00:16:44,768 --> 00:16:50,367
fabric and circle like this one which banishes gradually in the air will you know I'm

191
00:16:50,943 --> 00:16:53,632
ones that disappear when you add water to it

192
00:16:55,711 --> 00:16:59,168
so I'm doing slightly different cross-stitch cuz I want them to be separate crosses on the

193
00:16:59,200 --> 00:16:59,392
room

194
00:17:02,047 --> 00:17:03,616
so what I've done has just gone a long and done

195
00:17:05,088 --> 00:17:08,063
one side of the crops and then I'm just going to go up

196
00:17:09,855 --> 00:17:10,880
just like crossed it truly

197
00:17:11,936 --> 00:17:15,264
down so another option if you do want to decorate

198
00:17:16,416 --> 00:17:20,192
either this one or you destocking is to do some free machine and broidery on the

199
00:17:20,287 --> 00:17:24,479
same machine or you could even use some of the supreme set stitches on your mushing

200
00:17:24,511 --> 00:17:28,767
in this meshing to got one with a huge range of decorative stitches what I would

201
00:17:28,832 --> 00:17:36,640
recommend though is perhaps drawing out the shape of the design ordered to the fabric but

202
00:17:36,703 --> 00:17:38,816
maybe not cutting it out straight away just to you've got

203
00:17:39,904 --> 00:17:43,712
more fabric to move with and then you can cut the actual shape at

204
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:46,784
once you get your decoration on that

205
00:17:48,192 --> 00:17:53,312
case I don't rather wanky looking and were as such as that but never mind the

206
00:17:53,728 --> 00:17:58,144
building that so what you need to do next is do you want to add any

207
00:17:58,336 --> 00:18:02,079
I'm order these out like stitching to secure your green peas

208
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:09,855
so you can either do something like a backstitch you're running stitch or blanket still it

209
00:18:09,887 --> 00:18:12,447
would look a bit different on back the way to the edge

210
00:18:17,855 --> 00:18:22,112
I avoided this when you went there and I know in the class the of the

211
00:18:22,176 --> 00:18:25,663
day we did three strands and then we just like no one and but what I

212
00:18:25,791 --> 00:18:29,312
do as I used to you strands and then I get the two and its to

213
00:18:29,375 --> 00:18:34,656
meet a possemen doing up see you in love with for strength so it's so I

214
00:18:34,719 --> 00:18:37,312
divide up I pick out the two and I put my thumb through

215
00:18:43,232 --> 00:18:59,232
the can left that attached

216
00:19:01,984 --> 00:19:07,008
right so I've got a little back feet it's really smaller so happily will hold so

217
00:19:07,135 --> 00:19:10,656
this is field backpiece I just got be easier to sit down before you want the

218
00:19:10,719 --> 00:19:14,112
cardboard and stitch it together so what you need to do is

219
00:19:16,128 --> 00:19:20,800
you do that prudishly it's just position it where you want it to go wriggly someone

220
00:19:20,864 --> 00:19:20,991
like

221
00:19:22,463 --> 00:19:26,368
and then you see without whole lives in the middle get to just stitch several times

222
00:19:26,560 --> 00:19:28,832
on this side and you like coming through it now

223
00:19:30,144 --> 00:19:34,463
and then go to the side you and do the same until it feels really secure

224
00:19:41,439 --> 00:19:46,144
that you can't get there over the hole for the invite you stay hold this terrible

225
00:19:46,848 --> 00:19:50,784
right so I've got a bigger for each back so it's got three old

226
00:19:51,968 --> 00:19:52,767
interruptions

227
00:20:02,816 --> 00:20:03,008
and

228
00:20:05,343 --> 00:20:13,791
we won't go to get so we went to get someone to get some so brings

229
00:20:19,680 --> 00:20:19,744
you

230
00:20:21,536 --> 00:20:22,624
got so go back touch

231
00:20:34,656 --> 00:20:38,592
okay so we're gonna attach to the better carpels but I don't any the way stairs

232
00:20:38,624 --> 00:20:41,855
just use that double side it takes it's not like we can wash this right so

233
00:20:42,208 --> 00:20:47,520
I'd recommend pissing your crumpled but only flat next now that the bridge sex by hard

234
00:20:47,552 --> 00:20:51,680
to the touch so you want it really central the got a nice even border on

235
00:20:51,712 --> 00:20:51,936
the edge

236
00:20:55,104 --> 00:20:56,703
yeah yeah just make sure those two

237
00:21:00,416 --> 00:21:01,536
pieces from send us

238
00:21:04,384 --> 00:21:09,119
right the just Carter's school back just to it facts are just gonna adat one side

239
00:21:09,183 --> 00:21:10,560
and sped toward

240
00:21:24,991 --> 00:21:28,576
came and the bed that was I to take to this side it's okay kids you

241
00:21:28,608 --> 00:21:29,119
can of own but

242
00:21:34,079 --> 00:21:35,680
I just go be easy to use the flat piece

243
00:21:42,239 --> 00:21:53,407
with a bit harder on the shiny side of the cobbled

244
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:01,984
really

245
00:22:03,135 --> 00:22:19,135
busy nourished there and you were

246
00:22:21,536 --> 00:22:23,391
right so what situla wants to run the edge

247
00:22:26,303 --> 00:22:27,744
the free of to do it smaller than

248
00:22:37,343 --> 00:22:41,343
discuss the carcass in the way so again you could make this without gargled in the

249
00:22:41,375 --> 00:22:43,968
middle I just think it gives their level structure

250
00:22:53,663 --> 00:22:54,239
back fast

251
00:22:58,687 --> 00:22:59,423
enough

252
00:23:30,719 --> 00:23:32,735
on the other one I made intubated chain stitch

253
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:15,520
its cause of brought a Christmas decoration I'm going to add a little better one of

254
00:24:15,583 --> 00:24:18,624
the sort that young to be like the leap the other down to

255
00:24:38,432 --> 00:24:39,647
cut the string on the top of the bubble

256
00:24:40,895 --> 00:24:41,024
tree

257
00:24:46,848 --> 00:24:51,008
for a dancer's to us recording this really is

258
00:24:55,744 --> 00:24:57,952
what coast in don't forget to like unsubscribe

259
00:25:10,208 --> 00:25:13,504
very I almost got it in your stocking

260
00:25:23,488 --> 00:25:27,423
so here's another one I made the only test when I did before we were hunters

261
00:25:27,936 --> 00:25:32,416
and so is another bubble decoration here but I've actually done three machine embroidery which I'll

262
00:25:32,543 --> 00:25:36,832
add a little video of me doing that and what I would recommend if you are

263
00:25:36,864 --> 00:25:41,855
using machine stitches or doing free machine and broke broidery is to not cut the bauble

264
00:25:42,336 --> 00:25:47,167
and design out straight away maybe trace that honors you know where it where the order

265
00:25:47,264 --> 00:25:50,624
will be but then if you've still got it on your piece about will be a

266
00:25:50,687 --> 00:25:55,008
lot easier to move the fabric ground and the and spacing felt help if you're doing

267
00:25:55,072 --> 00:25:59,135
through machine broidery and having that one back you about because then you don't need a

268
00:25:59,199 --> 00:26:03,520
hoot is the who could damage the belt and that will be Sefer just doing regular

269
00:26:03,583 --> 00:26:07,680
stitches there are a lot of beautiful preset stitches on sewing machines so you could just

270
00:26:07,712 --> 00:26:12,479
do some really nice lines on that just add a bit of detail and but yeah

271
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:16,223
I would keep it on the main bit of felt because otherwise and they could get

272
00:26:16,287 --> 00:26:20,255
chewed up by the machine at the ends to just something to bear in mind okay

273
00:26:20,352 --> 00:26:24,800
so that's it for today O'ahu enjoyed this video and were probably try and a record

274
00:26:24,864 --> 00:26:29,407
another one scene we're at she got another ideas we might not wait another year but

275
00:26:29,439 --> 00:26:30,592
what we do another craft they

276
00:26:31,904 --> 00:26:35,296
knew so this is a nice little simple idea that you could do it if you

277
00:26:35,391 --> 00:26:41,119
want to add a little not towards Christmas and to join in the festivities if you

278
00:26:41,151 --> 00:26:43,423
don't want to go on a low in a job like this

279
00:26:44,671 --> 00:26:48,223
and yet so that's it for today thanks torching that you to like us to strike
