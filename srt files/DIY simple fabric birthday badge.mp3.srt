00:00:00,607 --> 00:00:04,288
today I'm going to show you how to make your own fabric birthday badge if you

1
00:00:04,352 --> 00:00:08,607
like this video and tamid already please don't forget to like and subscribe so I can't

2
00:00:08,640 --> 00:00:14,239
take credit for today's tutorial it comes care to see of my mum or brother she

3
00:00:14,368 --> 00:00:18,079
made a badge and I've had a look at it and trying to replicate or so

4
00:00:18,687 --> 00:00:23,072
and she made this batch for me for one of my birthdays and you can see

5
00:00:23,167 --> 00:00:26,944
roughly what the construction of it is so there's a little circle in the middle where

6
00:00:26,975 --> 00:00:33,279
she's converted the age there are two outer circles so you got the front and the

7
00:00:33,408 --> 00:00:37,631
fat and then in the middle you can fill this something sandwich there so I'm in

8
00:00:37,695 --> 00:00:41,888
my case of gayeties garbled I'm assuming at the cardboard which is used embroidery thread to

9
00:00:42,048 --> 00:00:46,624
stitch the circles all together and make a bit decoration out of it and then she's

10
00:00:46,720 --> 00:00:50,560
finally added a ribbon to step and a little bit more flares there is almost a

11
00:00:50,591 --> 00:00:55,263
bit like a result rather than a badge and she's put a safety pin on the

12
00:00:55,296 --> 00:00:59,743
back thanks to my mom for the inspiration of this video and yet I'm completely ripping

13
00:00:59,807 --> 00:01:04,288
off this design so for this you will need to draw out three templates they are

14
00:01:04,351 --> 00:01:08,255
circles those so you could potentially just draw them on to the materials straight away if

15
00:01:08,319 --> 00:01:12,959
you want to make it the slice that I'm doing you will need a small circle

16
00:01:13,279 --> 00:01:16,928
which will go in the middle where your embroidered the number that one I've done is

17
00:01:16,991 --> 00:01:19,424
a fight in half a centimeter diameter so it must just be

18
00:01:20,447 --> 00:01:24,416
a bit over a couple of inches you will need to cut out a cardboard center

19
00:01:24,959 --> 00:01:30,080
so I've done miners nine sense metas diameter and you will need an outer circle so

20
00:01:30,367 --> 00:01:34,655
you'll cut to bits of fabric out of this one and so it'll be the front

21
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:38,208
of back and this one I've done is twelve ten meters so I mean you can

22
00:01:38,272 --> 00:01:42,879
display it via you know just find some cylinder things at home you know different parts

23
00:01:42,975 --> 00:01:46,816
and jars here are the resources you'll need to make a bad she like I am

24
00:01:47,071 --> 00:01:51,807
you will need a couple of different fabric scraps so I have chosen a really small

25
00:01:51,839 --> 00:01:56,800
scrap here this will be part of the inner circle and that all have the number

26
00:01:57,407 --> 00:02:01,344
it all to so this is this a bit of navy cost and robot really to

27
00:02:01,407 --> 00:02:06,080
see any scraps should work fine and I've got a much bigger fabric for out there

28
00:02:06,431 --> 00:02:11,104
to some polka-dot navy as well and and this will be the outer circles on my

29
00:02:11,199 --> 00:02:16,000
badge so as you can eat the colors go quite well together you could do contrasting

30
00:02:16,095 --> 00:02:22,880
colors you know flash a couple of different persons possibly I guess as things fairy mind

31
00:02:22,944 --> 00:02:26,751
is with a smaller circle because you're going to be embroidering the number on it all

32
00:02:26,815 --> 00:02:29,888
you know about a message on that you might want to have it a bit planer

33
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:36,031
or the pattern not being too busy just so you can appreciate your hand embroiders work

34
00:02:36,192 --> 00:02:39,423
at the end beyond these to its fabric scraps you will also need a bit of

35
00:02:39,488 --> 00:02:43,296
ribbon or some sort of trimming this is just to add a nice though at the

36
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:49,279
bottom you will need a back for the branch so I've got I'm a brooch fixing

37
00:02:49,343 --> 00:02:54,688
here but you could possibly just tell on to say sleep in it depends you you're

38
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:59,520
making it for and port resources are available you need a cardboard circle in the middle

39
00:02:59,583 --> 00:03:03,455
this just is a bit more reinforcement so and I've already cut out my some type

40
00:03:03,488 --> 00:03:08,671
heresy and so this was the nine centimeter circle and I've just used regular is quite

41
00:03:08,703 --> 00:03:13,024
then called achieve and you could use a thicker one to make a bit more substantial

42
00:03:13,503 --> 00:03:17,919
this is optional I've got some double-sided tape I'm just purely going to users to help

43
00:03:17,983 --> 00:03:24,832
me likely fix the fabrics against this cardboards just to help me when I'm stitching around

44
00:03:24,895 --> 00:03:28,128
to secure its and but we see you don't have to have that you could pin

45
00:03:28,192 --> 00:03:34,335
it in an entirely optional additional results but it could be helpful you need some embroidery

46
00:03:34,399 --> 00:03:39,264
press so I've decided that these stitching I'm going to add it's going to match my

47
00:03:39,423 --> 00:03:45,759
ribbon so I've been with this lovely orange I've got regular systems for cutting my double-sided

48
00:03:45,792 --> 00:03:50,240
tape and every scene if you haven't got out long cut board template for the middle

49
00:03:50,751 --> 00:03:55,936
you can use them cut that out I've brought some embroidery Sissons and for when I'm

50
00:03:56,031 --> 00:03:58,304
handing bettering elements and sewing

51
00:03:59,455 --> 00:04:03,167
I also got pink inches to make a knife decorative edge to my circles that I'm

52
00:04:03,199 --> 00:04:06,880
going to cut out you will also need a darning needle little later stay with your

53
00:04:06,912 --> 00:04:10,783
own broidery threat and you might want a fabric can if you are just directly drawing

54
00:04:10,815 --> 00:04:14,848
the circles onto the fabric over ready for something that you might want to use if

55
00:04:14,912 --> 00:04:18,783
you have one at home which is a little embroidery hoop just to keep your fabric

56
00:04:18,847 --> 00:04:24,799
toss well you stitch the digits on to your badge front in case the best I'm

57
00:04:24,864 --> 00:04:28,928
going to draw the circles out on to my fabric so with the and this small

58
00:04:28,992 --> 00:04:32,799
circle this is going to have the digits and brought it on to it so I'm

59
00:04:32,832 --> 00:04:36,032
not going to cut the outset way I'm just going to mark where the cycle will

60
00:04:36,096 --> 00:04:39,615
be and I'll do it roughly in the center of the fabric because I'm going to

61
00:04:39,648 --> 00:04:41,503
put it in an embroidery hoop next

62
00:04:43,776 --> 00:04:48,320
I'm going to at the digits as well just give me a guideline of where to

63
00:04:48,384 --> 00:04:48,640
stitch

64
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:56,096
I'm going to use my fabric come to draw on this polka-dot fabric and I'm going

65
00:04:56,127 --> 00:04:56,704
to on the river

66
00:05:00,191 --> 00:05:03,967
up I mentioned for the two larger circles you can cut these out I'm going to

67
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,183
use my thinking chairs straight away

68
00:05:19,071 --> 00:05:24,447
there my two large little bit now it's time to so out the digits so as

69
00:05:24,511 --> 00:05:25,407
you can see I am

70
00:05:27,135 --> 00:05:30,399
going to turn braider sixty on this one so for my embroidering

71
00:05:32,544 --> 00:05:32,959
I have

72
00:05:34,496 --> 00:05:39,936
two strands of embroidery threat but then I've bubble that over the say is actually I'm

73
00:05:40,544 --> 00:05:46,272
for strands thick I'm going to do a chain stitch around but obviously you could use

74
00:05:46,432 --> 00:05:47,712
or ever sit you family

75
00:06:20,671 --> 00:06:22,463
they know I'm going to

76
00:06:30,208 --> 00:06:34,175
know you but your number embroiders like so you could probably do it at the end

77
00:06:34,239 --> 00:06:37,183
if you want to see but it might be that trickier than the cobbles and place

78
00:06:37,951 --> 00:06:43,936
I'm going to position its onto my front large circle I might actually work out where

79
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,631
the middle is say I'm just going to

80
00:06:46,687 --> 00:06:48,608
hold it and half twice

81
00:06:55,424 --> 00:06:57,855
this is the blunt and pollution of it back

82
00:07:00,063 --> 00:07:00,223
just

83
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:07,808
so I can see a little glimmer so I'm just gonna see if it looks sorrow

84
00:07:07,903 --> 00:07:12,191
it may be just it slightly I'm pretty happy with that so I might just get

85
00:07:12,256 --> 00:07:16,640
a couple of ends and to popping in place so being careful of my pens I'm

86
00:07:16,671 --> 00:07:20,992
not going to stitch this want to up front fabric know I realized that I don't

87
00:07:21,216 --> 00:07:25,088
use orange for this know I'm going to use some white to match the paper up

88
00:07:25,503 --> 00:07:28,608
this time I'm going to do our half the thinnest I might don't take out to

89
00:07:28,735 --> 00:07:32,096
France but I'm not as she going to double it over because

90
00:07:33,343 --> 00:07:38,623
I would like it to look thinner than the numbers thinks well actually with this one

91
00:07:38,687 --> 00:07:41,727
I'm just going to do a running stitch and I'm just doing it really close to

92
00:07:41,791 --> 00:07:42,272
the edge

93
00:07:43,552 --> 00:07:44,447
just so it tickles

94
00:07:45,471 --> 00:07:50,175
its own is a nice decorative search but it's not attracting too much from the numbers

95
00:08:05,088 --> 00:08:06,048
its merits the

96
00:08:07,808 --> 00:08:13,888
front big circle and the little settle attached I am now going to at my carpels

97
00:08:14,079 --> 00:08:18,208
peace so and just going to place it roughly in the middle going to admit of

98
00:08:18,272 --> 00:08:21,247
dog cided tape just to keep it in place will

99
00:08:22,592 --> 00:08:26,880
secure it so I would just hold lightly and that it had another bit to the

100
00:08:26,976 --> 00:08:27,903
other side of the card was

101
00:08:35,135 --> 00:08:38,495
so what you could do if you want to Nessen up if your two seconds don't

102
00:08:38,591 --> 00:08:41,599
her line he could then go around on the thinking she's again so I might do

103
00:08:41,664 --> 00:08:45,119
under the and I'm not sure like to see his so what you can do is

104
00:08:45,216 --> 00:08:51,296
just cut out that a cold without confitures at first get to the stage and then

105
00:08:51,392 --> 00:08:56,607
drum them and then they will align much better so I'm now going to do stitching

106
00:08:56,736 --> 00:09:01,984
around to secure the concord in the middle I'm going to go back to chainstitch what

107
00:09:02,047 --> 00:09:06,591
you could do is actually the stage you could add the back fixin but I'm just

108
00:09:06,656 --> 00:09:10,880
going to do the and even though it might be a bit tricky with this card

109
00:09:10,943 --> 00:09:11,455
would center

110
00:09:13,888 --> 00:09:17,471
let you know and then you can decide whether it's once and with stitching the digits

111
00:09:17,632 --> 00:09:18,304
I'm going to

112
00:09:19,487 --> 00:09:59,583
double up my threat so it's for strand sexo final touch apart from having the back

113
00:10:00,255 --> 00:10:04,192
is to add the ribbon so it's going to be a nice little the bottom

114
00:10:37,343 --> 00:10:42,752
very final there is to add the bridge so free gonna pick quite high up at

115
00:10:42,783 --> 00:10:47,840
the top so that it was intercity much and I want it to the level with

116
00:10:47,903 --> 00:10:48,447
the writing

117
00:11:15,424 --> 00:11:20,671
okay so there you have it a birthday batch so obviously you could make it that

118
00:11:20,768 --> 00:11:24,703
bigger or perhaps make me in a circle of it larger so that you could add

119
00:11:25,151 --> 00:11:32,255
a message or put birthday boy goal for it's my birthday something like that having just

120
00:11:32,288 --> 00:11:37,791
put the back into this ivory would recommend attaching it before you put the cardboard in

121
00:11:37,856 --> 00:11:40,960
now you just what we really caffeine a bunch of the fabric but it probably is

122
00:11:41,023 --> 00:11:45,408
a bit easier I'm not sure this very was driving both ways and I will say

123
00:11:45,504 --> 00:11:48,992
press this ribbon a bit because it is a bit Cresap that's it for today thanks

124
00:11:49,056 --> 00:11:49,504
for watching
