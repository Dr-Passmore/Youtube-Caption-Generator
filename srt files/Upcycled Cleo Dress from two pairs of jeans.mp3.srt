00:00:00,575 --> 00:00:04,383
hello today I'm going to talk to you about my telling of the buttons clear dress

1
00:00:04,992 --> 00:00:09,791
so I decided to make this and as part of the great British throwing the challenge

2
00:00:09,824 --> 00:00:16,128
hosted by satisfaction and I was hoping to make this anyway and but I was planning

3
00:00:16,191 --> 00:00:19,936
to make it towards the end of the year that kind of love between Christmas and

4
00:00:19,968 --> 00:00:20,288
new year

5
00:00:21,472 --> 00:00:25,343
which I know sounds very organized that I've had that plan in place for so long

6
00:00:26,208 --> 00:00:31,263
that anyway when I saw although I think one of the weeks challenges was to upcycle

7
00:00:31,808 --> 00:00:35,391
and so I thought great let's get this project

8
00:00:36,448 --> 00:00:39,903
brought forward and get it done for the serving a challenge

9
00:00:40,928 --> 00:00:44,768
so I've made this out of two pounds that's why sixteen jeans

10
00:00:46,431 --> 00:00:50,080
so what I'm going to do so they'll be dupont's to this video the first part

11
00:00:50,111 --> 00:00:53,759
I'm just going to really briefly review the pattern because length of people make the clean

12
00:00:53,824 --> 00:00:59,680
agraffes I'm and that's not much else really to say on that subject and just so

13
00:00:59,743 --> 00:01:03,807
you asked me how I found the pattern and second I'm going to show you how

14
00:01:04,096 --> 00:01:08,319
I managed to cut out the pieces from two pairs of jeans I'm just in case

15
00:01:08,351 --> 00:01:12,800
someone intrusted I would say that the key address is a really good one and for

16
00:01:12,863 --> 00:01:18,143
up so I think just because the pattern pieces a very simple and quite nice shapes

17
00:01:18,239 --> 00:01:18,367
so

18
00:01:19,391 --> 00:01:26,080
it's a good I'm jumping point to giving some confidence in upcycling and but yeah that's

19
00:01:26,143 --> 00:01:31,519
why I chose of this beautiful person in particular the one too many fits and I

20
00:01:31,615 --> 00:01:36,192
know it's nice like campus to be during mark on so calmly show you the thing

21
00:01:36,255 --> 00:01:41,503
address on the moment I only have it on my dusable when I reviewed happen but

22
00:01:41,632 --> 00:01:45,344
I was wearing it today anyway so I go I just review it while I'm iring

23
00:01:45,407 --> 00:01:45,760
it so

24
00:01:49,216 --> 00:01:52,639
okay so as you can see I'm late the new life version

25
00:01:56,416 --> 00:02:00,575
which in the new x version it does have a I'm as less at the front

26
00:02:00,736 --> 00:02:05,856
but I'm actually I saw people of illness I reversed and visit in the back so

27
00:02:06,496 --> 00:02:10,848
we can see it but yes it's a Ansalon instead of a frontlet

28
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:16,384
and see it open with the hip pockets as well and about more to do with

29
00:02:16,447 --> 00:02:21,087
the fact that I'm upcycle to from the genes so I've taken to it back pockets

30
00:02:21,184 --> 00:02:24,992
from one of the sets jeans and stitch them where I would have

31
00:02:26,272 --> 00:02:27,647
the patch book it's for the hip points

32
00:02:29,376 --> 00:02:33,664
and I've come with I'm doing some visible topstitching cochair they can

33
00:02:34,751 --> 00:02:35,391
just what sea

34
00:02:37,567 --> 00:02:42,335
and I'm currently wearing it with the Frankie teacher from the stretch but also by Tilly

35
00:02:42,399 --> 00:02:48,063
once so in times of difficulty it's a really simple make and because you're making it

36
00:02:48,479 --> 00:02:53,888
out with a nice stable woven fabric and such in this case of denim I would

37
00:02:53,919 --> 00:02:59,520
say the main challenge is that you got most players of then refugees to and make

38
00:02:59,583 --> 00:03:02,527
it in down but if you choose a it's like you like to wait fabric might

39
00:03:03,072 --> 00:03:07,360
it will be a lot easier and all the books say I do like this that

40
00:03:07,488 --> 00:03:12,927
denim desiccant it's really substantial I find it doesn't really crease the awful lot and it

41
00:03:13,024 --> 00:03:18,815
just some it's really nice to wear and so I would say about cycling if if

42
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:23,039
there's by a lot of the fabric that still I'm not bad quality or it is

43
00:03:23,104 --> 00:03:28,671
a nice quality that unlike seems to up then I'd really recommend using that I'm just

44
00:03:28,703 --> 00:03:33,151
because you might get a good value wife summat of it instead of spending lots of

45
00:03:33,184 --> 00:03:35,423
money order I'm any piece of fabric

46
00:03:37,472 --> 00:03:40,800
I forgot to mention as well at least I thought one of the stacks of jeans

47
00:03:41,024 --> 00:03:46,496
I've made up front that and I'm Morrissey's the packaging his pockets from the other pair

48
00:03:46,559 --> 00:03:50,944
of jeans because they look with different and but on the back of used that set

49
00:03:51,039 --> 00:03:51,167
of

50
00:03:52,768 --> 00:03:58,207
the other set of genes to cut some of the pieces will though we do combat

51
00:03:58,272 --> 00:04:02,751
of the other and jeans on the I could work with them quite got it out

52
00:04:03,552 --> 00:04:08,927
in one piece from the other surgency it's a really simple make I made a science

53
00:04:09,055 --> 00:04:12,671
for which of what I normally do footing on the pasty and the Boston and of

54
00:04:12,735 --> 00:04:17,696
patterns terms of other variations about from obviously adapting the fabric over the same all the

55
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:21,951
James I was using and to make some fit I didn't make any adjustments to the

56
00:04:22,015 --> 00:04:25,152
pattern apart from and moving the front slit run to the back

57
00:04:27,328 --> 00:04:31,776
I didn't actually lengthen it even watches and something I'm normally tempted to do on a

58
00:04:31,839 --> 00:04:36,575
person time taken and to sew up the actual person it's a really quick make you

59
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:38,816
can definitely do in a day of keeping my to it

60
00:04:39,967 --> 00:04:43,424
I say even a beginner it's just some of the topstitching that might be a bit

61
00:04:43,455 --> 00:04:47,648
of an issue that you could see matching topstitching and not have to worry as much

62
00:04:49,855 --> 00:04:54,816
you'd say the longest part for me was having to a pixie from the jeep the

63
00:04:55,519 --> 00:05:00,768
original sense of jeans as you can imagine they're really well made so and equally see

64
00:05:00,864 --> 00:05:02,208
how lucky they get

65
00:05:03,808 --> 00:05:08,063
yes what than people who seems first which is the one reason why spend this project

66
00:05:08,096 --> 00:05:12,223
of work as I had started to dismantle these genes and then it was taking so

67
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:16,415
long that I gave up probably took the most time on top sketching just because I

68
00:05:16,511 --> 00:05:22,048
wanted it to look nice and even yes my overall impression of this person is I

69
00:05:22,175 --> 00:05:28,544
definitely like this make it's interesting I was that you sure about the to address to

70
00:05:28,608 --> 00:05:32,799
start with just because it is quite a basic passed in I wasn't sure if it

71
00:05:32,832 --> 00:05:35,424
would be that plaster regal good of raw choir's

72
00:05:36,735 --> 00:05:41,471
has no rectangular figure I'd say anyway so I was unsure but is going to extend

73
00:05:41,503 --> 00:05:47,104
to wait that up and down look but I'm actually now made it I'm wearing it

74
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:52,063
it's so comfortable and I don't think it looks about that all so that the little

75
00:05:52,127 --> 00:05:58,239
round really nice first pretty easy and I make and yes about that on the review

76
00:05:58,432 --> 00:06:00,799
so next I'll show you how exactly I

77
00:06:01,855 --> 00:06:06,623
made this primitive as a gene Celexa with pockets from one set of James

78
00:06:07,936 --> 00:06:09,888
the front peace is made from

79
00:06:10,976 --> 00:06:14,847
one set of genes as you can Texas in the same color and then the back

80
00:06:14,976 --> 00:06:19,679
peace I have to stitch together from a few bits of the fabric left yeah so

81
00:06:19,712 --> 00:06:22,432
it made the straps out of one of the

82
00:06:24,415 --> 00:06:28,096
bricks I think it's been so I got the pockets from

83
00:06:29,247 --> 00:06:30,656
as you can tell it like

84
00:06:34,015 --> 00:06:40,223
and some facing probably worth noting that was also made from the other fabric I did

85
00:06:40,256 --> 00:06:42,175
have to make out two pieces so

86
00:06:44,032 --> 00:06:48,735
I added the seam allowance unstitch that together to in order to have enough fabric to

87
00:06:48,832 --> 00:06:53,023
make a matching face in peace anyway that's not for me I'll show you the lips

88
00:06:53,088 --> 00:06:53,152
now

89
00:06:54,175 --> 00:06:59,776
okay sir and as you can see I've already unpicked the most of the scenes on

90
00:07:00,223 --> 00:07:04,959
the two pairs of jeans so I'm just turning them I'm meeting them up a bit

91
00:07:05,023 --> 00:07:05,183
here

92
00:07:10,687 --> 00:07:16,735
right so this is when I was making the back pieces it didn't have enough

93
00:07:18,847 --> 00:07:23,424
with on the trials of legs to fit the whole backpiece all as you can see

94
00:07:23,552 --> 00:07:26,752
there so what I thought was all keep

95
00:07:27,776 --> 00:07:33,600
and because this pair of jeans had a same the front I believe had an additional

96
00:07:33,664 --> 00:07:36,256
seem so I thought I'd utilize that and

97
00:07:37,791 --> 00:07:42,752
square them off and then add a bit of the other pair of pair of jeans

98
00:07:43,584 --> 00:07:48,384
to make it a bit wider so you can see her I'm just I'm picking the

99
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:50,368
hem of the other

100
00:07:52,096 --> 00:07:52,895
bit of the jeans

101
00:07:55,552 --> 00:07:59,231
off again so I've taken off the top part which I might use in the future

102
00:07:59,424 --> 00:07:59,872
project

103
00:08:01,696 --> 00:08:02,720
yes this fiscals

104
00:08:05,536 --> 00:08:11,872
guillotines really handy actually for doing life street cuts such as this so this day of

105
00:08:11,903 --> 00:08:17,471
the pair of jeans so and you can see I'm just again I'm gonna square off

106
00:08:17,536 --> 00:08:19,584
a bit so that I can join it

107
00:08:21,791 --> 00:08:24,063
one to that the other perogies

108
00:08:30,944 --> 00:08:32,736
just get rid of the cab edge

109
00:08:34,719 --> 00:08:37,440
you can see the color difference where the scenes were as well

110
00:08:43,328 --> 00:08:45,536
Yep and then that's all the other side as well

111
00:08:51,583 --> 00:08:54,335
right so once I had them there you can see I'm now

112
00:08:57,088 --> 00:09:00,096
making sure that they appear the same way

113
00:09:01,119 --> 00:09:02,304
I'm also you know so

114
00:09:03,807 --> 00:09:08,288
when it was stitched up it would it would mirror each side of the back pieces

115
00:09:08,351 --> 00:09:13,664
so the right back peace would match up with the left back peace so here I

116
00:09:13,728 --> 00:09:16,799
am just unpegging it together

117
00:09:19,487 --> 00:09:21,312
so here I am just

118
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:24,544
check in my seen lance and I'm just stitching

119
00:09:25,599 --> 00:09:26,943
these two pieces together

120
00:09:46,559 --> 00:09:52,351
okay so that's one side done so I moved on to the other back he spied

121
00:10:03,552 --> 00:10:06,208
there are essentially creative two additional seems

122
00:10:16,288 --> 00:10:21,856
then I got my overlooker out and I believe have just overlocked on one side

123
00:10:25,984 --> 00:10:27,135
and then so I

124
00:10:28,192 --> 00:10:33,056
tried to mimic the other team in the genes so

125
00:10:34,304 --> 00:10:42,015
menisci caught turns the seam allowance on the edge there I'm not going to a block

126
00:10:42,656 --> 00:10:57,023
so then I could press him trimming the seam allowance of both

127
00:10:58,047 --> 00:11:02,656
pieces on the bit that on the edge that I haven't overlocked so that then I

128
00:11:02,783 --> 00:11:06,752
can press it and then do a bit of topstitching

129
00:11:07,935 --> 00:11:15,200
and it looks like here I have used contrast thread to empty this top statue

130
00:11:22,687 --> 00:11:24,736
looks like I'm just doing it some poor then

131
00:11:27,007 --> 00:11:32,671
his family make sure the attention is correct on you topstitching and yet so we've done

132
00:11:32,768 --> 00:11:34,432
to do one of the pieces now

133
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:37,119
I will see using

134
00:11:38,239 --> 00:11:44,223
a walking but second see so I'm just to help it feed through a bit more

135
00:11:44,288 --> 00:11:46,400
consistently than a regular but

136
00:12:01,343 --> 00:12:03,072
then I moved on to the other side

137
00:12:27,487 --> 00:12:28,479
he so with that done

138
00:12:30,015 --> 00:12:33,440
I then decided and which parts I wanted to be at the center back

139
00:12:35,424 --> 00:12:40,703
I lined the two layers up together so that they would look symmetrical

140
00:12:41,728 --> 00:12:45,280
so that new seem I just created I ensured that they brace

141
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:50,111
on both pieces they laid on top of each other I'm here I'm just

142
00:12:51,231 --> 00:12:55,520
I'm marking the notches I think on the other side or me just making it a

143
00:12:55,552 --> 00:12:56,736
bit clearer so that you can see

144
00:12:59,072 --> 00:13:03,903
okay Salena was trying my best to match up with the grain on the fabric

145
00:13:15,392 --> 00:13:19,935
then I started off with a rotary castor but actually it was quite challenging because

146
00:13:23,872 --> 00:13:27,648
you so you can see here that I then decided to pin it because

147
00:13:29,664 --> 00:13:34,015
the jeans were made of such a thick denim it was moving around as I tried

148
00:13:34,047 --> 00:13:39,552
to use either the rotary cutter all this is is so I have decided it was

149
00:13:39,616 --> 00:13:40,192
best to pin

150
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:45,247
and then I used my dress-making scissors to cut around it

151
00:13:52,383 --> 00:13:52,960
is the reason I

152
00:13:53,984 --> 00:13:58,143
cut out the back peace first was just because I was making it out of the

153
00:13:58,239 --> 00:14:02,080
offcuts the other so I'd already had a look at the pattern and

154
00:14:03,296 --> 00:14:03,392
the

155
00:14:04,512 --> 00:14:09,280
person dunes I had and figured that I could make I think it was out of

156
00:14:09,312 --> 00:14:15,679
the back pieces of one pair of jeans I could I knew that I could cut

157
00:14:15,807 --> 00:14:22,015
out the front pieces of the clear out of it so I wasn't concerned about that

158
00:14:22,111 --> 00:14:25,823
I was just concerned about and the back pieces which as you can see

159
00:14:28,159 --> 00:14:31,648
cut out them so I just wanted to be sure about those pieces out before I

160
00:14:31,776 --> 00:14:38,304
cut any of the smaller bits because worse comes to work especially the and facing I

161
00:14:38,432 --> 00:14:43,455
could have done in a different fabric okay so in sequel I'm pretty sure it's the

162
00:14:43,520 --> 00:14:47,679
back piece of two of the genes so when I got to this stage I then

163
00:14:47,776 --> 00:14:51,455
realized that actually it was only just enough for him

164
00:14:52,479 --> 00:14:58,463
and I've got to be honest I'm not completely sure that I did cut it exactly

165
00:14:58,559 --> 00:14:59,296
on the grain line

166
00:15:01,151 --> 00:15:06,976
because it was such a narrow margin to get it to fit on that peace because

167
00:15:07,072 --> 00:15:08,736
of the shape of the front of the clear

168
00:15:10,719 --> 00:15:16,992
and as you can see her I'm deliberating and awful lot trying to work out how

169
00:15:17,247 --> 00:15:17,343
to

170
00:15:18,591 --> 00:15:19,135
fix it

171
00:15:21,023 --> 00:15:21,823
to the fabric

172
00:15:29,184 --> 00:15:33,343
anyway looks like I came to a decision like I say I think it is slightly

173
00:15:33,408 --> 00:15:38,143
off the green line but because it's not just early fabric it hasn't made it hasn't

174
00:15:38,176 --> 00:15:39,903
made too much of a different but

175
00:15:41,023 --> 00:15:45,343
I mean if I did again I'd prepay a bit more attention to this

176
00:15:46,591 --> 00:15:51,296
and this point or just reduced the seam allowance on one side because I could have

177
00:15:51,392 --> 00:15:54,687
gone off slightly because you do get a one and half son tweeter

178
00:15:55,872 --> 00:15:57,695
and seam allowance on this pattern

179
00:16:07,424 --> 00:16:18,559
I wish I could cut as quick as this time LaHaye so here and I think

180
00:16:18,624 --> 00:16:24,320
the bottom layer I knew wasn't quite as wide as the top but if that broke

181
00:16:24,416 --> 00:16:29,536
so you can see that I just used the tailor's talk to line up exactly where

182
00:16:32,607 --> 00:16:37,247
the stitch line should be on that piece so I'd follow that when I am stitched

183
00:16:37,312 --> 00:16:41,695
out together and then I am marked where the pockets roughly needed to be although like

184
00:16:41,791 --> 00:16:45,984
I say I was using the back pocket so I didn't need to cut out those

185
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:46,432
pieces

186
00:16:48,255 --> 00:16:55,231
okay so with the remaining bit of the genes so I'm cutting out the final pieces

187
00:16:55,328 --> 00:16:58,400
so these of the straps on the clear

188
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:40,095
the bits I think I worked out that this was the best place and the best

189
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:40,767
placement

190
00:17:42,239 --> 00:17:44,095
utilize the fabric I had so

191
00:17:46,495 --> 00:17:48,319
I think I could only get those

192
00:17:49,823 --> 00:17:54,784
the curved parts I had to do it at the top of the end is it

193
00:17:55,167 --> 00:18:00,511
from at face value it looks like I'm cutting out really uneconomically and if you can

194
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:04,608
see the piece of the talks that I've just finished cutting up I've added a seam

195
00:18:04,671 --> 00:18:09,567
allowance and that cause you do cut it on the fold for this passion but because

196
00:18:10,271 --> 00:18:14,079
I couldn't caught it on the fold I didn't have a wide enough peace I was

197
00:18:14,144 --> 00:18:19,296
going to stitch it together and create a seem to make the full peace

198
00:18:22,079 --> 00:18:26,303
again it looks like I did it with the other curved peace as well

199
00:18:28,416 --> 00:18:30,368
as at the back facing it looks like

200
00:18:31,904 --> 00:18:33,855
you so I've added that

201
00:18:34,943 --> 00:18:39,839
seamounts there as well so the next step would be to stitch those

202
00:18:53,088 --> 00:18:56,447
there I am off on the machine and setting it again

203
00:18:57,952 --> 00:18:59,615
and in the correct color to friends

204
00:19:02,112 --> 00:19:07,520
I'm assuming I readjusted the tension from after the topstitching but I don't know the area

205
00:19:07,647 --> 00:19:12,095
like the effect because you can see where the pockets have been on those pieces

206
00:19:17,248 --> 00:19:21,215
okay looks like here I'm made about to add some notchers

207
00:19:25,536 --> 00:19:29,760
Yep there I think I'll just realized that there are more notches on the

208
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:38,047
the facings than I actually had on that piece so I'm just correcting at that okay

209
00:19:38,176 --> 00:19:43,968
and then here I'm just overlooking those and raw edges from the two seems that I

210
00:19:44,095 --> 00:19:45,151
created on the facing

211
00:19:47,456 --> 00:19:52,927
I hope you enjoyed seeing how I cut this pattern out of to his jeans thanks

212
00:19:52,991 --> 00:19:54,079
for watching and seizing
