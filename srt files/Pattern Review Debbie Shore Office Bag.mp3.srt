00:00:00,384 --> 00:00:05,087
hello today I'm going to do a pattern review on a bag passion for a change

1
00:00:05,728 --> 00:00:09,663
if you like this video don't forget to like and subscribe for more video content like

2
00:00:09,727 --> 00:00:15,039
this so this is back in question it is from the Debbie shore book brilliant bags

3
00:00:15,392 --> 00:00:20,895
this is called the office bag and I've just done the pattern as it is in

4
00:00:20,959 --> 00:00:24,959
the book they do have a couple of variations as one where you could put some

5
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:29,983
unbuckle straps on to make it look a bit more like unsexual I just decided to

6
00:00:30,176 --> 00:00:34,591
follow the person other it was for the first attempt the measurements I've used as well

7
00:00:34,751 --> 00:00:39,167
off from the pattern so obviously if you want to make a different size you could

8
00:00:39,327 --> 00:00:43,583
but you just have to make sure you adjusted all the parts of pieces correctly this

9
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:47,327
is these are the measurements that they give in the book so in terms of the

10
00:00:47,423 --> 00:00:53,055
fabric last I abused so the one on the outside you may have noticed it's from

11
00:00:53,119 --> 00:01:01,312
my prayer pinnacle which I reviewed a number of years ganar and its Ridgeley from fabrics

12
00:01:01,408 --> 00:01:05,440
below I got it from the missing and stitching show which was at west point and

13
00:01:05,568 --> 00:01:10,367
exercise and I obviously perched it a few years ago if I mean for a plentiful

14
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:13,823
then and so this was just made up with the remnants from that it is a

15
00:01:13,919 --> 00:01:18,400
needle called fabric which I was a little bit concerned about using just because I wasn't

16
00:01:18,431 --> 00:01:25,120
sure to be strong enough that the hardwearing use I'd put it through however what I've

17
00:01:25,183 --> 00:01:28,351
done is I've put into facing on it just to give it a bit more structure

18
00:01:28,447 --> 00:01:32,671
and reinforcements that it fully I don't end up taking hold a strict in terms of

19
00:01:32,736 --> 00:01:37,888
the mining I had to use a nice simple bold yellow cotton twill but was actually

20
00:01:37,952 --> 00:01:43,199
saving this fabric to make an apron so it's not technically a moment however I'm really

21
00:01:43,263 --> 00:01:47,295
hoping that Apache still got enough fabric to make the apron as well it is I

22
00:01:47,456 --> 00:01:51,360
still want to make that but I just couldn't resist using it for this past and

23
00:01:51,583 --> 00:01:56,127
just because I thought it complimented the main fabric so well I've also used a bit

24
00:01:56,160 --> 00:02:01,024
of bias finding so you can see about this little like marine marina red color and

25
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:04,160
I just happened to have a remnant of it and it was the perfect amount to

26
00:02:04,192 --> 00:02:08,735
be honest and I've also got if she could see in him I'm I needed a

27
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:13,759
longish since it and so fortunately I had on which match the boys finding which helps

28
00:02:13,983 --> 00:02:17,279
this battle so has some other items in each pictures so you need

29
00:02:18,304 --> 00:02:23,328
this twist look at the front to Fastnet August if you did survive to do a

30
00:02:23,391 --> 00:02:27,679
different variation of it if you did want to sparkle to need binos incense and you

31
00:02:27,744 --> 00:02:29,376
also need to the reins feel

32
00:02:30,912 --> 00:02:34,975
show disrupts you also need a swivel class I think it's called see anyone on either

33
00:02:35,072 --> 00:02:39,744
side there are Karakorum an extra chain but on this one I was just because I

34
00:02:39,839 --> 00:02:45,472
found it at home but and most that you by would just be connected like that

35
00:02:45,727 --> 00:02:49,792
another thing you do need for this pattern is fusible fleece it's just I'm this nice

36
00:02:49,951 --> 00:02:55,871
then stuff so it is not too noticeable but it does just give your bag an

37
00:02:56,031 --> 00:03:00,192
extra better structure so in times of difficulty it's quite a simple make to be honest

38
00:03:00,287 --> 00:03:03,839
I think it looks more complicated than it actually is personally for me I found the

39
00:03:04,063 --> 00:03:09,119
eyes finding wasn't too bad and it was quite a nice detail to add I'm really

40
00:03:09,184 --> 00:03:13,759
pleased with the result of it she's also got some really good instructions on how to

41
00:03:14,367 --> 00:03:19,264
attach the vice finding in the book there's a cotton what it's called it is the

42
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:23,776
design tool-kit at the start so and she's got all the main

43
00:03:25,311 --> 00:03:29,216
the main skills you need to learn at the start of the book for reference just

44
00:03:29,248 --> 00:03:33,983
because I guess they overlapped on him various patterns in the book so I found that

45
00:03:34,175 --> 00:03:36,416
yeah for the bias finding they had a couple of

46
00:03:38,304 --> 00:03:42,912
bits of advice which I haven't actually used the force and I found that it really

47
00:03:42,975 --> 00:03:46,880
did improve the finish so I was really happy with that the main part I found

48
00:03:46,944 --> 00:03:52,863
challenging was just stitching in the corners of the lining peace just because it's squat and

49
00:03:52,895 --> 00:03:55,072
and she wore two factions

50
00:03:56,287 --> 00:04:00,800
in that so it was a bit challenging stitching some of the corner bits apart from

51
00:04:00,863 --> 00:04:04,608
that though I'd say that it is really straightforward because you doing a lot of straight

52
00:04:04,671 --> 00:04:08,703
lines I say the only real curve is actually the spear when you were using the

53
00:04:08,735 --> 00:04:14,656
bias finding the other thing I found difficult was in the instructions it said to

54
00:04:15,776 --> 00:04:16,832
that you needed to stitch

55
00:04:18,048 --> 00:04:22,720
your strap and then turning turn it right sides out but you've actually looked both the

56
00:04:22,944 --> 00:04:27,967
lining piece on the exterior peace that interfacer it's really difficult to do that I think

57
00:04:28,032 --> 00:04:32,160
it was also made worse because I'm not sure I use the correct seem lances which

58
00:04:32,799 --> 00:04:38,656
I'll explain that a bit more detail while talking about clarity the clarity of the instructions

59
00:04:38,976 --> 00:04:44,191
wasn't great in my personal viewpoint but it might be because I'm just not used to

60
00:04:44,351 --> 00:04:48,096
Debbie shore passes this and I don't do in a wallful lot of

61
00:04:49,343 --> 00:04:53,279
I also don't do an awful lot of bag or accessory patterns I don't be either

62
00:04:53,343 --> 00:04:57,824
just make them at myself or just don't do any I couldn't see anywhere in the

63
00:04:57,920 --> 00:05:03,519
book where it said what the seam lances were and this might be assumed knowledge they

64
00:05:03,584 --> 00:05:09,343
we show does a lot of quoting based projects and I guess most quoting based pattens

65
00:05:09,471 --> 00:05:13,440
would use a court trivalent steam once so it might be that you're just assumed to

66
00:05:13,696 --> 00:05:17,440
you the call to minutes seem land I'm not sure or perhaps you're meant to you

67
00:05:17,567 --> 00:05:21,376
actually at the seam allowance in which his I've done this completely wrong I think it's

68
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:25,279
a real shame it doesn't specify that obviously if someone else has the look and I

69
00:05:25,376 --> 00:05:32,671
have noticed where the alliance's specified please let me know which page and which paragraph because

70
00:05:32,864 --> 00:05:36,735
I've had a look and I just can't see it anywhere and I generally don't know

71
00:05:36,832 --> 00:05:41,664
if I've just completely overlooked it and just can't sense because I wasn't sure on the

72
00:05:41,696 --> 00:05:45,600
seam allowance I went with half an inch just because other parts of the pattern asked

73
00:05:45,631 --> 00:05:48,735
for half an inch which isn't the best way to do it and as a result

74
00:05:48,768 --> 00:05:52,799
it did mean that my strikes were narrow his initiative in which might be why it

75
00:05:52,832 --> 00:05:56,447
was so hard to turn amount as a result has made me wonder within the whole

76
00:05:56,511 --> 00:06:00,320
bags half an inch smaller than it should be or you know if I've missed out

77
00:06:00,351 --> 00:06:07,135
the same lands entrance unicum significant you know significantly smaller than it should be but

78
00:06:08,287 --> 00:06:10,944
the main frustrating part was I had to source new

79
00:06:12,864 --> 00:06:17,440
gnudi rings and the little class unfortunately I did find something at home basically it's the

80
00:06:17,503 --> 00:06:19,391
reason why I brought a match slider

81
00:06:20,959 --> 00:06:27,264
still the hearing and told us and the sort of rusty run colored twist look at

82
00:06:27,328 --> 00:06:31,903
the front I was originally gonna have it all in this I'm the color of the

83
00:06:32,447 --> 00:06:36,544
twist lock that they would just wait too big for the bag of the and so

84
00:06:37,055 --> 00:06:40,544
I had to go for something a bit smaller I don't think the strap actually looks

85
00:06:40,575 --> 00:06:45,888
that bad this thing but obviously it was just a shame I can use the items

86
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:50,303
that had brought to go with it that was what a mistake actually on what pieces

87
00:06:50,399 --> 00:06:54,656
you cut so they got the lining based on the lining sides incorrect so I don't

88
00:06:54,687 --> 00:06:56,959
have it's just someone doesn't pass and test

89
00:06:58,175 --> 00:07:02,592
and double check everything is correct or you know it's just an error that just what

90
00:07:02,687 --> 00:07:07,519
overlooked but anyway so watch out for that urgently I could just come off some pieces

91
00:07:07,936 --> 00:07:11,712
and because I used a solid color on the inside and I wasn't too worried by

92
00:07:11,839 --> 00:07:15,839
which way the constant will and diagnosed were going but obviously if you did have a

93
00:07:15,903 --> 00:07:21,216
directional print you but we have to recut out those pieces again which is a bit

94
00:07:21,247 --> 00:07:24,671
of a waste of fabric the book is really good because it has got lots of

95
00:07:24,864 --> 00:07:29,664
images in it but I did feel like at times it did need a bit more

96
00:07:30,463 --> 00:07:35,679
information it kind of felt like it to jump between instructions bets and again it might

97
00:07:35,743 --> 00:07:38,880
just be because I'm not yeast making bags but I do feel like if you are

98
00:07:38,944 --> 00:07:42,015
a beginner you might struggle with us to little just to show see you you can

99
00:07:42,079 --> 00:07:46,079
see this there are some lovely instructions here but yeah I just felt that it

100
00:07:47,872 --> 00:07:52,544
in some places it needed just a little more beiden the other part I found quite

101
00:07:52,608 --> 00:07:57,664
unclear was that it didn't explain that well how you attach the the lock on the

102
00:07:57,727 --> 00:08:03,359
back to the main outer bag section and it might just be me misinterpreting it I'm

103
00:08:03,424 --> 00:08:08,063
not sure but I felt the end of results so he personally was that it looks

104
00:08:08,127 --> 00:08:12,992
quite nesty only inside out what this I'm line him and where the top to chickens

105
00:08:13,376 --> 00:08:17,312
and then there's obviously the same where the flap attaches to the main peace but I

106
00:08:17,407 --> 00:08:22,463
feel like it hasn't come out that brilliantly in terms of the design of the bag

107
00:08:22,687 --> 00:08:27,071
I'm really pleased with the end results and I really like the design I'm a big

108
00:08:27,167 --> 00:08:33,056
fan of shoulder bags anyway so that is the main pattern out of the book which

109
00:08:33,216 --> 00:08:37,567
appealed to me which is why I've done it first really like how the struck is

110
00:08:37,632 --> 00:08:42,047
attached separately and that it's fully adjustable I really like the lining of this bag and

111
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:47,968
this is probably the main appeal to me now I didn't understand how the lining worked

112
00:08:48,031 --> 00:08:52,479
out before I made it now I've made it I really like how she's designed the

113
00:08:52,831 --> 00:08:57,088
inside the fat so if you have a look here of left time what cried and

114
00:08:57,151 --> 00:09:00,960
in here just was itching how much you can fit in here and all so there

115
00:09:01,023 --> 00:09:02,176
are two open sections

116
00:09:03,455 --> 00:09:06,304
and there is a zit compartment in the middle

117
00:09:07,359 --> 00:09:11,104
and actually this part of the instructions I did find quite place to understand

118
00:09:12,416 --> 00:09:17,088
and I just really like it so as you can see you could easily but some

119
00:09:17,216 --> 00:09:23,168
April documentation in one of the open spaces of added to walk a few a five

120
00:09:23,231 --> 00:09:27,840
no books in here and Yakut Melia room as you know snapped up

121
00:09:28,992 --> 00:09:33,760
extra shopping bags and put my glasses and then I can get more secure items in

122
00:09:33,823 --> 00:09:39,359
the dip section obviously you could add some more pockets or compartments if you wanted you

123
00:09:39,392 --> 00:09:45,504
know to keep your house keys in or that anejo phone and but actually I found

124
00:09:45,536 --> 00:09:49,119
that this works really well for me all their might add more sections if I made

125
00:09:49,184 --> 00:09:52,703
another one depending on the purpose of the bag I say you feel like it's quite

126
00:09:52,736 --> 00:09:57,567
secure political that's it section in the middle but you also this time turn class on

127
00:09:57,632 --> 00:10:02,815
the front works really well time taken is quite a tricky one to answer the longest

128
00:10:02,848 --> 00:10:07,200
section by far is cutting out all of the pieces and like a dress-making pattern you

129
00:10:07,263 --> 00:10:10,719
need to create what the pieces yourself do either need to draw out all the different

130
00:10:10,752 --> 00:10:15,072
side for rectangles you need or you need to and draw them straight onto your fabric

131
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:20,703
you obviously got to be really careful that you know you draw those out accurately as

132
00:10:20,768 --> 00:10:24,895
it will impact the final design you also need to make sure that you cut out

133
00:10:25,151 --> 00:10:30,143
your sections the right way up so if you've got a directional prince like the one

134
00:10:30,208 --> 00:10:33,599
I've got in the front and because this needle board has a slight nap to it

135
00:10:33,952 --> 00:10:37,280
you need to make sure that you've got the pieces the right way up and that

136
00:10:37,471 --> 00:10:41,504
the Paston is running the right way I say making up the actual bag is really

137
00:10:41,664 --> 00:10:46,559
quick your stitching lots of straight lines so that makes it really fast so that's pretty

138
00:10:46,624 --> 00:10:51,679
much overall I'm really happy with it although I just have issues with the pattern and

139
00:10:51,776 --> 00:10:52,736
the fact that they did

140
00:10:54,047 --> 00:10:59,007
make a couple of errors in the pattern probably because they don't get anyone to pass

141
00:10:59,104 --> 00:11:04,927
and test it that was a shame however I feel that is also really careful with

142
00:11:04,992 --> 00:11:09,440
the person and keep this in mind it is a brilliant end result and I really

143
00:11:09,536 --> 00:11:11,616
like how she was a blind this bag so

144
00:11:12,671 --> 00:11:16,320
agree with does get a thumbs up from me so inspired by making this bag and

145
00:11:16,351 --> 00:11:20,416
to that she makes a couple of accessories to go with it I made this water

146
00:11:20,447 --> 00:11:24,992
bottle carrier and just because I will bring a bottle water out with me when I'm

147
00:11:25,023 --> 00:11:29,375
on the go and obviously it didn't fit in the main bag and sometimes I don't

148
00:11:29,408 --> 00:11:34,047
want to store it in my main bag anyway just thinking you know I'm accidentally leeks

149
00:11:34,432 --> 00:11:40,159
and ruin something in my main back I also made a little zipped couch or pass

150
00:11:40,255 --> 00:11:45,088
to go with it just because I have a few small items and work related that

151
00:11:45,151 --> 00:11:48,223
I need to bring with me to work I was always trying to find them in

152
00:11:48,288 --> 00:11:52,544
my old bag so I thought if I made a little bit and passed it would

153
00:11:52,799 --> 00:11:57,023
mean that they were kept together so with these two items I just made up my
