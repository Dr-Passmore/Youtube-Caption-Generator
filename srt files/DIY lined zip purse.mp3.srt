hello in today's video I'm going to show you how to make a simple zipped purse

1
00:00:05,119 --> 00:00:10,560
with the lining been started by tell you what I used to make this pass I

2
00:00:10,815 --> 00:00:15,199
used as if so my one was a fifteen centimeter along them

3
00:00:16,576 --> 00:00:19,520
I cut out to outer pieces in the main fabric

4
00:00:20,736 --> 00:00:24,959
I caught mine and thirteen by eleven centimeters and if he did want to make the

5
00:00:25,024 --> 00:00:28,544
same size one eye was a cut of a fusible place just because I used on

6
00:00:28,607 --> 00:00:32,063
the matching bag and I had a bit left over I cut out to line in

7
00:00:32,127 --> 00:00:36,703
pieces the same size as the outer pieces and I caught our bit of a break

8
00:00:36,768 --> 00:00:40,543
for the key rings have you only need about for Bible centimeters but I had a

9
00:00:40,639 --> 00:00:44,895
scrub so I didn't actually fat it down immediately you also need a the puppet in

10
00:00:44,959 --> 00:00:49,888
the first step which is entirely optional depending if you're using useful place is to add

11
00:00:50,304 --> 00:00:55,967
the futile place to the main fabric pieces that will be only outside of your past

12
00:00:57,312 --> 00:01:01,215
with this fusible place it takes about twelve seconds I think and the one I've got

13
00:01:01,279 --> 00:01:02,080
any way to a deer

14
00:01:07,872 --> 00:01:11,648
the first actual step is to attach one main fabric peace and one mining place to

15
00:01:11,711 --> 00:01:15,968
sit for a cup them images of world to help you so first you place one

16
00:01:16,031 --> 00:01:20,928
of your main fabrics right side up you place the zip right side down onto the

17
00:01:21,216 --> 00:01:25,344
main fabric peace so that the edge line up with the top edge of the main

18
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:29,791
fabric next you have the lining piece on top of the zip right side down so

19
00:01:30,015 --> 00:01:34,624
the lining peace and the top edge will line up with that edge of visit and

20
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:41,279
the top of the outer these so intact and then machine stitches in place using using

21
00:01:41,311 --> 00:01:42,239
her press Evert

22
00:02:07,807 --> 00:02:11,712
once you from that's called the main and line pieces back so that the right side

23
00:02:11,776 --> 00:02:15,583
for now facing outwards and press it in place so that you can now see the

24
00:02:15,647 --> 00:02:16,063
zip again

25
00:02:18,912 --> 00:02:23,839
second surface to attach the remaining main and lining pieces to the place the remaining main

26
00:02:23,904 --> 00:02:28,000
fabric PC have in front of you right side up and then placed the visit once

27
00:02:28,128 --> 00:02:34,880
more down on top and but again facing downwards and then like before then sandwich as

28
00:02:34,944 --> 00:02:40,576
if again by putting the lining the remaining lining fabric peace over the top right slide

29
00:02:40,671 --> 00:02:46,272
down in tap and then machine stitch in place using your the progressive at once more

30
00:02:57,151 --> 00:03:01,184
and again once ditched all the main allying pieces on the second flight back so that

31
00:03:01,311 --> 00:03:05,248
that it can be seen between the two main fabric pieces and the two lining pieces

32
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:07,455
press with the iron and then chop which

33
00:03:17,535 --> 00:03:21,759
you also need to secure the dipper either and so just a little line of stitching

34
00:03:21,856 --> 00:03:25,759
at both ends just that when you open it a little bit later if you won't

35
00:03:25,856 --> 00:03:29,664
they we've become disjointed and keep it shape the next you need to make the new

36
00:03:30,143 --> 00:03:34,975
the curing layers to me to folder loop fabric in half and press unfold and then

37
00:03:35,104 --> 00:03:39,679
from the raw edges to meet the boat line you created refold at of old-line so

38
00:03:39,744 --> 00:03:43,167
that the raw edges and our tax in the middle search close to both of the

39
00:03:43,231 --> 00:03:46,944
long edges you won't need to neaten up the raw edges as they'll be on the

40
00:03:47,039 --> 00:03:51,839
inside of your past and then stitch close to both long edges

41
00:03:55,296 --> 00:03:59,839
one can a half some of the raw edges together and an already to attach to

42
00:03:59,871 --> 00:04:03,776
the main peace so set number five is to stitch the sides and base of the

43
00:04:03,839 --> 00:04:08,287
past an important thing to notice to keep this it open to ensure that you can

44
00:04:08,384 --> 00:04:13,951
turn the best right side out hold the person of the lining pieces line up together

45
00:04:14,175 --> 00:04:19,328
right sides facing and the main fabric pieces match up right side facing they need to

46
00:04:19,391 --> 00:04:23,200
decide where you're going to position your name way you would like it on the side

47
00:04:23,264 --> 00:04:27,231
of your past the need to and put it in between the two main pieces of

48
00:04:27,264 --> 00:04:31,135
fabrics that when you turn it out the right way it will be on the outside

49
00:04:31,519 --> 00:04:35,679
so pin attack and then stitch all the way around the back that remember to leave

50
00:04:35,776 --> 00:04:39,104
a gap of the bottom of the lining for that you can turn it right side

51
00:04:39,167 --> 00:04:39,359
out

52
00:04:58,911 --> 00:05:03,712
the final step steps on the six is to turn about very side house finish the

53
00:05:03,808 --> 00:05:07,584
lining base and added hearing so as you noted by already asked to come on mine

54
00:05:07,743 --> 00:05:11,936
before turning the first right way out recommends trimming the colors of the bag and possibly

55
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:16,511
the seam allowances throughout with pink quiches this will have a few debts and better points

56
00:05:16,704 --> 00:05:20,000
on the corners of your past so want to trim that any can push it through

57
00:05:20,191 --> 00:05:24,384
so that the right side is now facing Albert's and you can use Evelyn's angle a

58
00:05:24,447 --> 00:05:28,511
tool to fish out those corners do with the lining still picking out of the best

59
00:05:28,608 --> 00:05:33,567
you'll need to then finish off and the gaps it to you called the pass through

60
00:05:33,824 --> 00:05:37,312
so with this you can either slip stitch in place where you could just miss the

61
00:05:37,567 --> 00:05:41,920
regime such very close to the edge to secure as well depending what finish you want

62
00:05:41,951 --> 00:05:42,687
to the inside

63
00:05:49,152 --> 00:05:52,544
they once that don't you just need to talk the lining inside the first and zip

64
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:56,735
it up I meet if you haven't already at the keyrings belief and your damn you

65
00:05:56,832 --> 00:06:00,704
can change the size of the sick person you just leave changed the dimensions of the

66
00:06:00,959 --> 00:06:05,088
main and lighting piece of the fabric and it's just a really useful person you could

67
00:06:05,279 --> 00:06:10,144
make a little gift sat for a friend and by Pinson stationary inside it or obviously

68
00:06:10,239 --> 00:06:14,623
it's perfect as a pass to hold point then we could even store your buttons stash
