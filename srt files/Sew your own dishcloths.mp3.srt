hello so today's video is a nice simple quick make which you can make for yourself

1
00:00:05,472 --> 00:00:11,199
or as a gift for others the project today is a dishcloth recently my mom got

2
00:00:11,263 --> 00:00:15,680
into making her own dishcloths to be a bit more sustainable also their great for using

3
00:00:15,744 --> 00:00:20,544
up scraps of fabric if you have some left over from other projects this dish cloth

4
00:00:20,639 --> 00:00:24,864
is simple to make it uses a bit of hessian or burlap for one side for

5
00:00:24,895 --> 00:00:31,648
when you need a more abrasive surface for cleaning which won't damage any nonstick surfaces the

6
00:00:31,711 --> 00:00:37,055
soft decide is simply cotton and can be made from any of your favorite remnants there's

7
00:00:37,152 --> 00:00:40,703
also a bit of plain cotton in the middle to make them as sustainable as possible

8
00:00:40,959 --> 00:00:45,023
you need to use a hundred percent natural fiber fabrics and thread this will ensure that

9
00:00:45,088 --> 00:00:49,183
the dishcloth can buy the degrade here I have used a cotton fabric as I have

10
00:00:49,312 --> 00:00:53,631
loads of remnants of this and the one I'm using in this video is a remnant

11
00:00:53,728 --> 00:00:59,327
from making fill some pajamas but another natural fibers such as linen would work just as

12
00:00:59,391 --> 00:01:03,583
well if you'd like to make a few dishcloths either for yourself or to give to

13
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:08,384
others I'd recommend making a cardboard template to make it easier to cut out a batch

14
00:01:08,704 --> 00:01:12,959
particularly if you're using a rotary cutter so moving on to what you'll need you'll need

15
00:01:13,024 --> 00:01:19,136
the following to make a nine centimeter by fourteen centimeters dishcloth but obviously you can make

16
00:01:19,263 --> 00:01:23,776
it whatever size you'd like you need to cut out and eleven by sixteen sense me

17
00:01:23,903 --> 00:01:29,599
so remnant of he-she and or ballot fabric for the non scratch scourer aside and eleven

18
00:01:29,888 --> 00:01:36,127
by sixteen centimeter remnant of a hundred sent plain cotton or another natural fiber for the

19
00:01:36,192 --> 00:01:41,183
middle of the cloth and finally an eleven by sixteen sent me to remnant of another

20
00:01:41,599 --> 00:01:46,208
a hundred percent natural fiber fabric which you want to be on show on the outside

21
00:01:46,847 --> 00:01:51,487
on the soft side of the dish class you'll also need a hundred sent cotton threads

22
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:56,671
so the first step is with your he-she and fabric in front of you place the

23
00:01:57,248 --> 00:02:01,087
fabric you wish to have as the soft side of your dishcloth so the bit that

24
00:02:01,152 --> 00:02:06,047
you want to show on the outside place this right side down onto the piece of

25
00:02:06,143 --> 00:02:11,712
passion next place the plane piece of fabric you wish to use for the middle of

26
00:02:11,807 --> 00:02:16,832
the dishcloth on top so that the main cotton peace is now sandwiched between the plain

27
00:02:16,927 --> 00:02:21,343
cotton fabric and the hessian pin or peg the pieces together

28
00:02:26,111 --> 00:02:31,167
leaving a large enough gap for turning right side out so all three layers together using

29
00:02:31,264 --> 00:02:37,440
a one centimeter seam allowance I've given it a generous seam allowance of one centimeters considering

30
00:02:37,535 --> 00:02:43,679
how small it is but the hessian phrase quite a bit and arguably is the most

31
00:02:43,744 --> 00:02:48,768
challenging aspect of this project one thing I would recommend is to use a large enough

32
00:02:48,895 --> 00:02:53,472
stitch length because I found that if I used a to Titus stitch length it would

33
00:02:53,695 --> 00:02:58,432
all bunch up and crinkle a lot more clips the corners to reduce seem bulk and

34
00:02:58,464 --> 00:03:04,128
then turn right side out ensuring the corners or pushed out as you'll notice from this

35
00:03:04,352 --> 00:03:08,768
I probably should have left a slightly bigger gap to turn it right side out

36
00:03:16,639 --> 00:03:20,416
once I turned it right side out I gave it oppressed with the iron as well

37
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:25,440
just to help for the next stage so the next step is to so two lines

38
00:03:25,503 --> 00:03:31,936
of topstitching so the first line is sown close to the edge this will just mean

39
00:03:32,031 --> 00:03:35,712
that you won't have to slip stitch the opening chats the second line of stitching is

40
00:03:35,776 --> 00:03:39,647
parallel to this line and just a bit further ends for the one I'm doing here

41
00:03:39,839 --> 00:03:44,320
I just used the edge of my press of it as a guide and use that

42
00:03:44,608 --> 00:03:49,408
to sew a bit further and finally to keep the three layers secure in the middle

43
00:03:49,759 --> 00:03:54,783
so a couple of lines of stitching in whatever pattern you like or you can do

44
00:03:54,880 --> 00:04:00,352
what I've done in this video which is just do a random pattern it just stops

45
00:04:00,479 --> 00:04:05,248
it crinkling up too much in the middle and yeah you can do whatever pattern you

46
00:04:05,343 --> 00:04:10,048
like you could free machine I guess so there you have it a completed dish class

47
00:04:10,207 --> 00:04:14,944
the great thing about this make is that you can get it done in a spare

48
00:04:15,007 --> 00:04:21,407
half hour it's really handy its great because you can just recycle it when it's no

49
00:04:21,536 --> 00:04:27,615
longer usable and their great gift that you could make up really quickly another great thing

50
00:04:27,679 --> 00:04:32,191
about this project is that you don't need to worry too much about accuracy or what

51
00:04:32,256 --> 00:04:35,391
it looks like because at the end of the day you're going to clean your dishes

52
00:04:35,455 --> 00:04:39,264
with it or wipe down your worked up that's it for this time thanks for watching
