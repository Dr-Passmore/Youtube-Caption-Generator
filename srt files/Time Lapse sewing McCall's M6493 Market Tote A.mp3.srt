hello and welcome to the time lapse of me making the market tote from the cold

1
00:00:07,584 --> 00:00:09,472
stitch and save easy range

2
00:00:10,784 --> 00:00:15,423
is past a number and six for nine three and I'm making version a witch's the

3
00:00:15,487 --> 00:00:17,055
top one on the envelope

4
00:00:18,559 --> 00:00:22,879
for this tote version you need a base and doubts for the handles I made the

5
00:00:22,944 --> 00:00:27,072
base from the back of a cheap picture frame which no longer had the glass although

6
00:00:27,327 --> 00:00:32,319
the patterns suggest using the cardboard the dolls were cut to size as well

7
00:00:34,687 --> 00:00:40,256
I use medium-weight caudex style fabrics are both the main and lining fabrics the main fabric

8
00:00:40,352 --> 00:00:46,304
has foxes bowels and head trucks on and the lining is a colorful simple flower-shaped design

9
00:00:52,928 --> 00:00:58,624
the pattern says that interfacing is an optional extra I decided to use some for this

10
00:00:58,720 --> 00:01:00,416
project to give it more structure

11
00:01:03,167 --> 00:01:07,040
right the speed of this video will go up to one thousand two hundred and fifteen

12
00:01:07,167 --> 00:01:12,160
percent now I've had to speed it up so much because I've included all of this

13
00:01:12,288 --> 00:01:16,575
make from cutting out the pieces from the pattern sheet to sewing it up on the

14
00:01:16,639 --> 00:01:22,239
machine of use carbon paper to transfer the patterns onto the fabric as well which I'm

15
00:01:22,304 --> 00:01:25,024
not used to say this took a while as well

16
00:01:26,592 --> 00:01:29,664
April it took seven and a half hours in real time

17
00:11:26,111 --> 00:11:26,239
to

18
00:11:27,807 --> 00:11:27,903
the

19
00:19:29,663 --> 00:19:58,208
ability

20
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:06,975
to produce
