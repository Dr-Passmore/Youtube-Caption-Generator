hello today I'm reviewing the gable top why Jennifer Lauren handmade

1
00:00:12,416 --> 00:00:19,327
I've chosen the view on the pattern where there is a long sleep version where there's

2
00:00:19,423 --> 00:00:24,895
a different colored cough at the end so you have two sections for the sleeve only

3
00:00:25,087 --> 00:00:31,615
I've emitted the second half of the sleeve so that its now elbow-length as I've mentioned

4
00:00:31,648 --> 00:00:36,383
before not like you know long sleeve talks so this has made it a length the

5
00:00:36,928 --> 00:00:41,408
I prefer a lot more and the size I've made I believe it's the size twelve

6
00:00:42,335 --> 00:00:47,712
however it has come out quite tight and I don't know whether it's the fabric or

7
00:00:48,768 --> 00:00:53,599
I did trace it a while ago and maybe my weights fluctuated I'm not sure that

8
00:00:53,631 --> 00:00:58,335
the fabric of chosen I actually got as a remnant from west pointer Exeter when they

9
00:00:58,431 --> 00:01:04,480
had the missing and stitching hobby craft show so I'm not completely sure on the content

10
00:01:04,736 --> 00:01:08,767
it isn't it fabric and it's a lovely strike fabric

11
00:01:10,431 --> 00:01:16,127
looks like a single net jersey apart from that though I'm not completely sure on the

12
00:01:16,223 --> 00:01:21,055
content of it but it is a really nice quality and it feels really nice against

13
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:21,568
your skin

14
00:01:22,912 --> 00:01:28,384
in terms of difficulty for this pattern it is a really nice simple make as with

15
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:33,024
on it as brooks you have to be careful about you know making sure that you

16
00:01:33,087 --> 00:01:38,111
don't stretch the fat break so I'm not completely sure if I have stretched trick or

17
00:01:38,176 --> 00:01:40,896
not because it has turned out really long

18
00:01:42,272 --> 00:01:47,615
even for me and I normally like a nice them the length of tops but I

19
00:01:47,744 --> 00:01:52,416
haven't let them this pattern so I'm not sure if that fabrics just stretched a bit

20
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:58,463
with me or whether it's just this life anyway I did get a little bit confused

21
00:01:58,559 --> 00:02:02,015
on the neck band section I did have a look at the

22
00:02:03,232 --> 00:02:09,856
does a YouTube video by Jennifer Lauren which did help me clarify that I've actually done

23
00:02:10,175 --> 00:02:15,360
the topstitching very close to the top edge but you actually went to do it lower

24
00:02:15,423 --> 00:02:16,832
down just catching

25
00:02:18,175 --> 00:02:19,615
the bottom point of

26
00:02:21,024 --> 00:02:23,647
the raw edge on the underside

27
00:02:24,671 --> 00:02:28,735
in hindsight it probably would have been better if I had dipped down to follow where

28
00:02:28,832 --> 00:02:30,527
that's raw edge

29
00:02:31,552 --> 00:02:33,055
lays on the inside

30
00:02:34,207 --> 00:02:37,727
but as long as when I put it on I just make sure it's flat down

31
00:02:37,792 --> 00:02:42,304
that seems fine in terms of the fear as I already mentioned two or three times

32
00:02:42,623 --> 00:02:48,320
it does seem quite fitted I don't think it's necessarily meant to be like that but

33
00:02:48,416 --> 00:02:52,735
perhaps when I cut it out I was so busy trying to make sure that my

34
00:02:52,863 --> 00:02:58,240
stripes went across properly I may have accidentally stretched the fabric and that might be why

35
00:02:58,367 --> 00:03:05,376
it's it it snugger than anticipated however I do really like having these elbow-length sleeves the

36
00:03:05,472 --> 00:03:10,143
sleeves aren't site to actually it's just more the torso section but it might just be

37
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:13,279
that I'm so used to wearing loose pick garments that

38
00:03:14,912 --> 00:03:20,320
any closefitting garments freak me out regarding the design I really like the slash next style

39
00:03:20,384 --> 00:03:20,992
at the top

40
00:03:22,143 --> 00:03:26,975
again I like the oboe length of the sleeves not that it's technically a view but

41
00:03:27,007 --> 00:03:31,871
I've seen other people do it and which is what encouraged me to do it myself

42
00:03:33,184 --> 00:03:36,511
I do like it being really long as I say I probably would have liked it

43
00:03:36,576 --> 00:03:41,600
but Lisa so if I do again I probably will go a size up just so

44
00:03:41,727 --> 00:03:41,824
it

45
00:03:43,455 --> 00:03:47,776
feels a bit come fear for me regarding time taken that this was a really quick

46
00:03:47,968 --> 00:03:51,583
make he could probably do it and half a day it did take me a bit

47
00:03:51,679 --> 00:03:55,296
longer just because I was trying to make sure that my stripes

48
00:03:56,416 --> 00:03:58,591
matched as best as they could down the side

49
00:04:00,063 --> 00:04:05,311
top to visit you are going to get striping fabric the small of the stripes it

50
00:04:05,408 --> 00:04:08,768
means the more stripes you've got to match so that did take quite a bit of

51
00:04:08,863 --> 00:04:13,727
time but I'm really glad I took the time and have the patience to do that

52
00:04:13,824 --> 00:04:18,208
because I'm really happy with the result a rule I am really happy with this because

53
00:04:18,335 --> 00:04:23,839
it will pair nicely with the ivy pinnacle which I've already made I think it will

54
00:04:24,191 --> 00:04:31,007
look really nice I'm underneath that and other pinafores that I've made as well I think

55
00:04:31,104 --> 00:04:33,376
also it will be a nice and make

56
00:04:34,399 --> 00:04:40,384
to wear on top of you know skinny jeans or likings as well though it's definitely

57
00:04:40,447 --> 00:04:46,687
a lovely person I love the style but I definitely do things differently next time thank

58
00:04:46,752 --> 00:04:47,264
for watching
