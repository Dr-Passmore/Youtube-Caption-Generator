00:00:00,703 --> 00:00:05,504
today I'm going to review my makes from twenty nineteen if you like this video and

1
00:00:05,567 --> 00:00:09,248
have an already please don't forget to life and subscribe in case I'm going to cover

2
00:00:09,439 --> 00:00:16,128
three rough sections firstly I'm going to go through my project categories so just I'm key

3
00:00:16,832 --> 00:00:21,152
highlights of mix I've made this year I'm then going to move on to how well

4
00:00:21,215 --> 00:00:26,048
I did on my make nine projects and finally I'm just gonna mention some other key

5
00:00:26,143 --> 00:00:32,479
achievements and lessons learned from the year so instead of mentioning every single project I've made

6
00:00:32,608 --> 00:00:36,448
firstly I haven't kept the very good locks that I can't remember everything I've made I

7
00:00:36,543 --> 00:00:42,495
haven't logged everything online via the blog block or my Instagram feed so which is a

8
00:00:42,527 --> 00:00:46,335
role shame because it means I remember some of the stuff I have made but it's

9
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:50,591
just all that wiped out this year however I thought I'd mentioned the main highlights and

10
00:00:51,040 --> 00:00:55,840
that stand out for me so I've got with its five categories for this year and

11
00:00:56,032 --> 00:01:00,543
I'll go through those out so the first category is the most challenging make so I've

12
00:01:00,639 --> 00:01:05,152
chosen my main big knitting project for the year it was one of my make line

13
00:01:05,344 --> 00:01:10,559
of just rabbit it is this cardigan that the cop be holding an hour my color

14
00:01:10,655 --> 00:01:15,648
anyway said this is from the listing pattern that my mom's had in her such for

15
00:01:15,903 --> 00:01:20,031
years and she made from one to Dover she's made on the sheer as well she's

16
00:01:20,096 --> 00:01:22,688
made a blue version and yeah it's got this nobly

17
00:01:23,872 --> 00:01:28,031
pattern on it so it's quite fun to make well they we have learned that the

18
00:01:28,096 --> 00:01:28,928
different sizes

19
00:01:30,367 --> 00:01:35,615
depending which sides you need to make it's harder so my mom made a different slides

20
00:01:35,711 --> 00:01:41,152
to me and in the end she probably gonna think the same size she's realized but

21
00:01:41,216 --> 00:01:45,664
anyway so she did a different size but it turns out the increase in decrease it's

22
00:01:45,727 --> 00:01:48,127
a lot harder in that sizing

23
00:01:49,216 --> 00:01:53,503
so yeah but the size that I don't we make is nice to follow it fortunately

24
00:01:54,143 --> 00:01:58,304
and it has taken me pretty much most a year to make a I think the

25
00:01:58,400 --> 00:02:01,248
garment when I finished that it's at some point

26
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:05,919
in the autumn so I started it in January so it was a very long make

27
00:02:06,047 --> 00:02:07,424
for the I've had the wall for

28
00:02:09,279 --> 00:02:14,559
a number of years but yeah so I'm kind of happy with it it's it's one

29
00:02:14,591 --> 00:02:18,016
of those makes where when you finally finished it and you're just not too sure about

30
00:02:18,111 --> 00:02:22,048
sense which is folly put it like do you have to other cardigan's so I made

31
00:02:22,272 --> 00:02:26,944
a yellow version of this cardigan and quite a few years ago is my first rule

32
00:02:27,647 --> 00:02:30,688
make sail down in that respect it's

33
00:02:31,968 --> 00:02:36,160
it's not a real challenge to me because I have followed the pattern before however it

34
00:02:36,223 --> 00:02:41,216
was a challenge just its black and it's quite hard to see when your listing after

35
00:02:41,279 --> 00:02:47,968
work you know it's it's dark outside seagull reliant on artificial I've taken enter you know

36
00:02:48,031 --> 00:02:51,360
I did have to unravel let quite a number of times I do get a bit

37
00:02:51,423 --> 00:02:56,031
impatient as well so that's why it's probably my greatest challenge this year as well so

38
00:02:56,320 --> 00:03:02,048
to have the patience to keep finishing it throughout all of those months I'm for the

39
00:03:02,111 --> 00:03:06,559
big achievement for me see you I think this is something I don't think I've written

40
00:03:06,656 --> 00:03:11,936
a blog about I haven't blocked about it and I don't think I put the final

41
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:16,671
bowed again on Instagram that might change that thank you so over I'm happy with it

42
00:03:16,735 --> 00:03:21,856
I love the pockets of work with this and my main ambition is just to make

43
00:03:21,919 --> 00:03:26,207
one in a range of different colors so I could just open and a water open

44
00:03:26,272 --> 00:03:29,951
to see that all lined up together but we'll see because they do take a while

45
00:03:30,016 --> 00:03:34,367
to make the second project category is most fun make and that was an easy one

46
00:03:34,464 --> 00:03:39,072
to select it's the beach towel poncho I really enjoyed making this and it was a

47
00:03:39,136 --> 00:03:42,367
weekend that my mom came down to visit and I knew that she wanted to her

48
00:03:42,399 --> 00:03:47,455
and beach tell been so yeah we just put head together and created us so I'm

49
00:03:47,583 --> 00:03:51,296
as you could to see I'm if you've seen watch the video already we did make

50
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:56,287
it up as we went along so we started off you know trying to make shift

51
00:03:56,320 --> 00:04:01,664
the herds we ended up tracing around another hood that I'm we had offer and the

52
00:04:01,759 --> 00:04:05,567
day I had lying around but yeah really happy with the under as though I really

53
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:10,432
want to make myself one now as well on to most useful make the most useful

54
00:04:10,496 --> 00:04:15,871
make is definitely my Debbie short of this bag so I made this I think in

55
00:04:15,968 --> 00:04:21,600
September and it's really even useful already I haven't put it was my most useful make

56
00:04:21,696 --> 00:04:25,119
but actually the office bag was part of the south so I made a little dipper

57
00:04:25,216 --> 00:04:29,664
pouch to go with the office bag which I put them because I have a name

58
00:04:29,727 --> 00:04:34,687
budget work and if they got keys for work so I keep all of my useful

59
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:35,167
office

60
00:04:36,735 --> 00:04:40,096
have no year and that as though it just means that when I get to work

61
00:04:40,191 --> 00:04:43,872
I'm not like rummaging around in my bag tines of you know find the keys to

62
00:04:43,936 --> 00:04:48,063
let myself him I can just you know straight away find them in there because it's

63
00:04:48,256 --> 00:04:53,440
enlisted about and of course I made to the water water can courier as well which

64
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:57,888
I use quite a lot both at work and outside of work so yeah the whole

65
00:04:57,951 --> 00:05:01,984
steps being really useful they were a gift made and was a bit of a tricky

66
00:05:02,048 --> 00:05:07,135
one I've decided to go with the last main gift I made for Christmas this year

67
00:05:07,615 --> 00:05:13,471
and it fills bear themed pajamas at and what's going to choose the oven mitts I

68
00:05:13,631 --> 00:05:18,816
made for my sister and her family because that had an interesting sort of should whory

69
00:05:18,911 --> 00:05:24,063
design on it and I did remission quoting on it which to quite a lot of

70
00:05:24,096 --> 00:05:31,295
time and I also made the bias binding from scraps of Roman fabric that I used

71
00:05:31,839 --> 00:05:38,335
to make their aprons last year however what I really liked about films their pajamas is

72
00:05:38,432 --> 00:05:44,704
that I have the confidence to create a little hand embroidered that on the PJ top

73
00:05:44,992 --> 00:05:49,536
I don't of why but I've always been put off at using a plicae or hand

74
00:05:49,567 --> 00:05:55,391
embroidering onto pajama top just because it's made out of the net fabric I'm always worried

75
00:05:55,488 --> 00:06:00,511
that it will somehow distort the fabric or be a lot harder to attach or it

76
00:06:00,575 --> 00:06:06,239
might stretch out of we might get a stretch and look a bit strange and but

77
00:06:06,303 --> 00:06:11,455
obviously because the pajama top is loose fit by design I realized that this was a

78
00:06:11,488 --> 00:06:16,544
bit of a ford argument so what I did was by roughly with my joke pen

79
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:22,048
sketched out a design which I thought liked roughly like one of the bears on the

80
00:06:22,175 --> 00:06:24,096
printing fabric for the trousers

81
00:06:25,312 --> 00:06:29,696
and then I use chain stitch to stitch all the way around and did a French

82
00:06:29,791 --> 00:06:34,880
not for the I want to my favorite make I do like a lot of the

83
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:38,015
gifts I made and I got a lot of satisfaction out of making it for other

84
00:06:38,079 --> 00:06:43,295
people but I'm going to choose this year the clear what cycle I made what I

85
00:06:43,391 --> 00:06:48,864
really like about this make is that I made out of two pairs of jeans they

86
00:06:48,992 --> 00:06:53,471
weren't exact matches the the dice and the designs of the two sets of jeans I

87
00:06:53,536 --> 00:06:53,727
think

88
00:06:54,847 --> 00:06:59,552
I've managed to make them work well together the best thing about this make is although

89
00:06:59,679 --> 00:07:05,471
it took absolutely ages to unpick there seems of the genes is probably one of my

90
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:11,839
most one makes from this year the genes fabric the denim is so substantial it feels

91
00:07:11,967 --> 00:07:15,967
really nice to where I just felt so comfortable in it and yeah it's just nice

92
00:07:16,032 --> 00:07:20,160
to just check it on same leaving on to my many lines from this year so

93
00:07:20,415 --> 00:07:26,752
I chose nine projects I'm according to the make nine challenge and which you can find

94
00:07:26,783 --> 00:07:32,415
more information about on Instagram so out of my nine projects I managed to make four

95
00:07:32,511 --> 00:07:35,872
of them this year which is too bad I think it's

96
00:07:37,055 --> 00:07:40,671
one or two less than I may last year to the ones I did manage to

97
00:07:40,735 --> 00:07:47,104
make where the Molly dress which I enjoy wearing I managed to make the Bibi pitiful

98
00:07:47,936 --> 00:07:51,552
which another one I'm really happy with to the reason that one did get made quite

99
00:07:51,615 --> 00:07:52,640
quickly is because

100
00:07:53,824 --> 00:07:58,783
that was my fabric that I accident me cut out for the wrong project so I

101
00:07:58,880 --> 00:08:02,335
think to make myself feel better about it if you stopped the rest of that fabric

102
00:08:02,432 --> 00:08:06,687
making the baby privacy that Copley called again I showed earlier was one of my make

103
00:08:06,752 --> 00:08:11,488
lines and obviously the one that took the longest time a bit like the Croatia thrown

104
00:08:11,552 --> 00:08:15,519
made last year's for me was the most time and senses and finally I made the

105
00:08:15,552 --> 00:08:19,552
kinda card again which is another one and I really like the design although I guess

106
00:08:19,679 --> 00:08:23,455
the fabric I got for that I'm not as happy with and but still wearing it

107
00:08:23,552 --> 00:08:27,328
so it's so the ones I didn't get round to you I'm included making a to

108
00:08:27,424 --> 00:08:34,015
can teacher so gone old's chief swim see with a nice calamari sequin to come on

109
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:38,848
it and for some reason I'm help and so on turning it into a t-shirt I

110
00:08:38,976 --> 00:08:41,471
still really want to do this has kind of been the project this been in my

111
00:08:41,791 --> 00:08:44,575
in the back of my head the whole year and by the time I could have

112
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:48,864
got the guts to start creating it because my main concern and commit kind goes back

113
00:08:48,927 --> 00:08:55,007
to the I'm embroidering the bear on the pajamas I just worry about the I'm stretch

114
00:08:55,424 --> 00:08:59,872
of the net fabric having the two kimono which it's ridiculous I know which is why

115
00:09:00,223 --> 00:09:03,104
do you want to now get on with it so it didn't manage to make that

116
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:07,520
so it'll probably roll over onto my twenty Fenty make nine because I get for me

117
00:09:07,583 --> 00:09:11,424
want to make it so okay so I also said that I'd make a bag for

118
00:09:11,487 --> 00:09:15,711
other swimming or you get the reason I haven't is because the new the classes I

119
00:09:15,807 --> 00:09:21,119
was going to ended up getting canceled they kind of did restart again but but as

120
00:09:21,184 --> 00:09:24,512
the habit of going to them and with swimming we have a real look at issue

121
00:09:24,671 --> 00:09:28,736
but we go don't always use the look of these things so essentially I wanted to

122
00:09:28,768 --> 00:09:33,440
make a backlot fit really well into the lockers that are provided that I'm a bit

123
00:09:33,504 --> 00:09:38,911
suspicious on whether they might just reconfigure the whole locker space areas I'm not sure I'm

124
00:09:38,943 --> 00:09:41,952
going to get on you cells that however you could say because I did make the

125
00:09:42,047 --> 00:09:46,848
office back I have technically made a similar right in this year and one I knew

126
00:09:46,943 --> 00:09:51,104
I definitely knew said another bag or dimanche make list of vinyl back so this was

127
00:09:51,168 --> 00:09:55,903
actually for a gift and I were going to too much detail now but again I

128
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:01,119
probably will attempt to make it in twenty twenty instead I had included the art finishing

129
00:10:01,151 --> 00:10:06,848
the throat because I did get the whole set for the asked unknitting although I can't

130
00:10:06,911 --> 00:10:09,632
find a few issues so going to have to make up some of the swells I

131
00:10:09,728 --> 00:10:14,080
did not get around to this because I just spent so much time on the cock

132
00:10:14,176 --> 00:10:18,911
accordion I just think it around to its again I might possibly added to the twenty

133
00:10:18,976 --> 00:10:22,815
twenty list or I might leave it until a future here I would like to get

134
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:26,304
it done one day the final on it didn't get around to with the same house

135
00:10:26,335 --> 00:10:30,719
seven rich hundred I just yet didn't have time to make it and I don't really

136
00:10:30,815 --> 00:10:35,168
feel an urgent need for us they find me just a brief roundup of other cheapens

137
00:10:35,424 --> 00:10:40,895
and less and black land in twenty nineteen so the best major one is that I

138
00:10:41,023 --> 00:10:46,783
can definitely live off my fabric stash I've avoided fine fabric Fisher just so I could

139
00:10:47,104 --> 00:10:50,880
free up a bit space in my class it hasn't us so we worked out that

140
00:10:50,911 --> 00:10:55,072
way I guess now I tried to feel a bit more comfortable with my fabric stash

141
00:10:55,263 --> 00:10:58,848
this time last year I felt really stressed about it I just felt like it was

142
00:10:58,911 --> 00:11:02,976
a big overwhelming presence and love lets you know we don't have a huge amount of

143
00:11:03,007 --> 00:11:09,375
space in and it just felt like I was overpowering the flat with my crafts however

144
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:13,312
now I'm kind of a bit more appreciative of it because I've been able to make

145
00:11:13,856 --> 00:11:17,408
so many lovely makes and gets for other people yeah I guess I'm a bit more

146
00:11:18,432 --> 00:11:22,719
at peace with my fabric sash so I'm not as stressed about it now because I've

147
00:11:22,752 --> 00:11:27,487
really benefited from it and Christine work you from my such as you know helped a

148
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:32,127
bit financially as well because I spent an awful got on my crafts the air and

149
00:11:32,223 --> 00:11:37,088
just on small have a datary items another key achievement has been that I've consistently put

150
00:11:37,151 --> 00:11:42,656
out some videos on YouTube ever since I mused the clear up psyching video area I

151
00:11:42,848 --> 00:11:48,159
think since then I've been consistently posting video so I think I've had at least twenty

152
00:11:48,255 --> 00:11:53,247
videos in a row by now might slightly more that's been a real achievement obviously it's

153
00:11:54,047 --> 00:11:58,848
it's a lot habit for him making sure that you post out regularly on YouTube and

154
00:11:59,328 --> 00:12:01,856
so like have got into a bit of the stories that that which I'm really happy

155
00:12:01,919 --> 00:12:05,984
with another thing that I've learned this year is a list of passing custom so I

156
00:12:06,047 --> 00:12:11,168
went to a couple of local persons on doing a better of passing casting one of

157
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:16,640
them fakest or creating your own block from scratch and the other one was about adapting

158
00:12:16,736 --> 00:12:22,495
a block to fit in measurements both were really interesting and it's definitely shaped how I

159
00:12:22,624 --> 00:12:28,640
look at dress-making I would actually say I think that's why my productivity went down with

160
00:12:28,703 --> 00:12:33,567
it it was spring summer just because and then felt a bit over one's white how

161
00:12:33,664 --> 00:12:37,760
much I needed to think about when adjusting a person now the lesson I've learned this

162
00:12:37,791 --> 00:12:44,320
year is how to adjust my craft making to how I'm feeling so because of my

163
00:12:44,416 --> 00:12:51,487
chronic ownness I do have what I call crashes and when these happen it's really difficult

164
00:12:51,679 --> 00:12:56,320
to dress make in particular because I don't know it just seems to take a lot

165
00:12:56,383 --> 00:13:03,328
more efforts doing things like letting my hands pressuring and even had embroidery the probably only

166
00:13:03,424 --> 00:13:09,823
one that you know I found really beneficial or even the handsewing bits interest makings you

167
00:13:09,919 --> 00:13:14,143
know feel showing up at him by hands which I quite enjoy I find that these

168
00:13:14,367 --> 00:13:15,392
have been really useful

169
00:13:16,479 --> 00:13:23,455
so I can still feel productive but I'm giving my body time to heal you to

170
00:13:23,679 --> 00:13:28,416
stop attacking itself and then I can't get back on stress making but you know it's

171
00:13:28,479 --> 00:13:33,440
handy to have some other craft that skin you know take the place of dress making

172
00:13:33,919 --> 00:13:34,208
when

173
00:13:35,231 --> 00:13:39,359
my body call cope with up the final point I want to make is that I've

174
00:13:39,455 --> 00:13:44,768
learned I really need a better method of tracking my makes I have not got a

175
00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:48,992
compressive list of what I made this year I know I have made some great things

176
00:13:49,151 --> 00:13:53,119
and I just can't think them in fact I've just remembered that I made and avoid

177
00:13:53,184 --> 00:13:55,424
a tablecloth for my grandparents which was

178
00:13:56,960 --> 00:14:01,471
he is a key make that the fissure siya this is exactly why I need some

179
00:14:01,599 --> 00:14:06,239
sort of method of tracking what I'm making so that's it for my review for this

180
00:14:06,335 --> 00:14:11,072
week the next time I'm going to go through my plans for twenty twenty and also

181
00:14:11,168 --> 00:14:13,791
how I'm going to track those unthankful watching
