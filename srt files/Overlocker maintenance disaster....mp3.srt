0
00:00:00,287 --> 00:00:03,904
jumped up and with you on house fix never looked to tell you the story of

1
00:00:03,967 --> 00:00:07,743
our overlook the disaster we had planned to you today is a quick video on how

2
00:00:07,967 --> 00:00:12,000
to do some maintenance terrible lucky machine today I wanted to bring a video to you

3
00:00:12,192 --> 00:00:18,271
on how to change the blades on your overlocker however we had a few issues during

4
00:00:18,304 --> 00:00:18,464
this

5
00:00:19,711 --> 00:00:24,031
say a few one big as she reversed itself is quite using you unscrew the blades

6
00:00:24,736 --> 00:00:25,535
you but the new blatant

7
00:00:28,031 --> 00:00:32,287
as I mentioned a reason update the dear I wanted to change the blade of my

8
00:00:32,416 --> 00:00:36,063
overlocker I probably have this machine about it yes now you

9
00:00:37,472 --> 00:00:38,304
probably guess

10
00:00:39,712 --> 00:00:43,840
so oversee it's why a long time to go without changing the blade so if anyone

11
00:00:43,903 --> 00:00:48,159
does know how often you to change the Blakey's what you know I have eased the

12
00:00:48,319 --> 00:00:51,903
overlocker increasingly over the last years as well know it's probably

13
00:00:53,119 --> 00:00:57,183
they probably worn out more in recent years that when I first courted you have been

14
00:00:57,248 --> 00:01:00,832
used the more birds also felt that you work it wasn't putting quite as was it

15
00:01:00,895 --> 00:01:06,143
used to know and then I had that big what's needle where it bent I will

16
00:01:06,239 --> 00:01:12,575
shape that didn't stop and disaster have you riesco which I think may have been caught

17
00:01:12,671 --> 00:01:17,695
by a lot of lives as well as potentially that needle was wearing out anyway Oh

18
00:01:17,888 --> 00:01:24,767
and I also a pair cap'n through and you and that probably blunted the and lakes

19
00:01:24,863 --> 00:01:29,760
as well so anyway the laid replacement was well over do so the first laid the

20
00:01:29,952 --> 00:01:34,304
upper blades which like the first went back to the fine I've even got some cities

21
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:38,688
of that one you can see it's just staring swimmingly there was a bit of resistance

22
00:01:38,751 --> 00:01:42,400
you know what if they have tight in this were quite a lot so you know

23
00:01:43,008 --> 00:01:45,632
and he did you know needed a bit of

24
00:01:47,872 --> 00:01:51,167
yeah I needed a bit of them just to get that one listens but once the

25
00:01:51,232 --> 00:01:55,839
descent it came off nicely replaced with the knee blade and their son perfect

26
00:01:56,959 --> 00:02:02,176
the lower blaze doesn't get quite the whole thing of this machine that is you don't

27
00:02:02,272 --> 00:02:06,367
have a huge man room to get a full-size reprover in nicer its top frowned

28
00:02:08,255 --> 00:02:09,087
it's after on the corner

29
00:02:10,207 --> 00:02:14,975
and although you can bring the part of the case out it don't love will give

30
00:02:15,007 --> 00:02:19,039
you much more room to work with so I don't think I've got a vestige of

31
00:02:19,104 --> 00:02:23,968
the initial attempts to Mr this in the low but but obviously after a while is

32
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:30,591
getting quite frustrated probably had ever feeling going on and I decided to stop recording with

33
00:02:31,007 --> 00:02:32,800
my right studio like we did try

34
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:39,744
what few different methods will try to get so we tried various screwdrivers we got our

35
00:02:39,807 --> 00:02:44,992
whole collection which has grown since for me in the last company and that I mean

36
00:02:45,055 --> 00:02:49,184
this openly not the next amazing the regatta said we go your little that you have

37
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:52,416
a working with technology you so

38
00:02:53,567 --> 00:02:59,199
we had the not so tools available that hopefully would we not to do the jobs

39
00:02:59,296 --> 00:03:03,583
we even got out of rust am which I didn't really think it had trusted but

40
00:03:03,615 --> 00:03:08,031
that may be a bit of something they began it might have helped listen this truth

41
00:03:08,416 --> 00:03:14,559
yes and at that then why why they're trying to increase resistance is a nasty bound

42
00:03:16,479 --> 00:03:20,895
Oh yeah like the trick where some it and have lost the thread on the dock

43
00:03:21,472 --> 00:03:24,832
and you the praise demons for and that abandoned but I think the last time we

44
00:03:24,895 --> 00:03:29,472
had was this old there was just breaking anyway and it wasn't quite enough and then

45
00:03:29,535 --> 00:03:33,632
I was looking in are covered of June so basically we have one main covers in

46
00:03:33,727 --> 00:03:38,688
our class which is chockablock and the right nightmare to guarantee was

47
00:03:40,832 --> 00:03:46,880
not the tickets to be honest if I didn't have such mixed that shit what we

48
00:03:46,975 --> 00:03:52,320
would be such a horrible covered true but obviously it's it's like having have ever been

49
00:03:52,352 --> 00:03:56,320
well but it does come at a cost so yeah I went in there to find

50
00:03:56,384 --> 00:04:01,216
my overlocker bag and go or maybe there's like a special through a special screwdriver for

51
00:04:01,279 --> 00:04:06,016
it but then I looked in there there wasn't any special screwdriver just a regular once

52
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:09,567
you get with the sewing machine so that that waste a lot a time as a

53
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:14,175
while and then I also got rid of a couple of other bits from the machine

54
00:04:14,272 --> 00:04:16,992
so I unscrewed a couple of other bits to see can you get to it better

55
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:21,023
there I just ended up chipping off at aplastic which I'm really not happy with

56
00:04:22,623 --> 00:04:27,552
and so there is a slight bit of plastic missing on the top yeah I mean

57
00:04:27,615 --> 00:04:31,135
it's mainly but design know it's missing and it obviously made a horrible noise

58
00:04:32,351 --> 00:04:36,063
and it doesn't affect the functionality of to I don't even think fabric with the catch

59
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:40,768
on it it's literally on the edge and it will be on the broken of had

60
00:04:40,895 --> 00:04:46,559
taken off the other but then I know I can't get that and willows the machine

61
00:04:46,592 --> 00:04:49,503
this Lottie well it road in front of the use of the machine

62
00:04:53,247 --> 00:04:58,496
and I made down to sharing photos of the interview with my mum and she and

63
00:04:58,559 --> 00:05:04,735
ten said the votives with my granddad and his opinion was to take it to an

64
00:05:04,864 --> 00:05:11,391
expert there's a machine repair place fairly local to us which obviously at the moment with

65
00:05:11,488 --> 00:05:16,000
lockdown we caught traveled that far so say based right next to a supermarket as well

66
00:05:16,096 --> 00:05:19,872
so it meant that we could tie him with an essential journey it was a little

67
00:05:19,903 --> 00:05:23,615
strange rere an

68
00:05:24,704 --> 00:05:31,071
ice-cream

69
00:05:32,704 --> 00:05:37,536
yes so essentially because the social distance sing a hand to drop off the machine step

70
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:37,855
back

71
00:05:39,391 --> 00:05:42,623
called their number day then came out with gloves and a mass

72
00:05:43,808 --> 00:05:48,063
had to look at it for asked the description wrote a note on it check the

73
00:05:48,127 --> 00:05:52,671
head on my details then took it away so yeah that's quite a surreal experience and

74
00:05:52,735 --> 00:05:54,432
over and amused than before as well stay

75
00:05:55,808 --> 00:05:57,503
because the door was closed it was

76
00:05:58,592 --> 00:06:02,623
a shed on an industrial estate best way to destroy but yes I went to the

77
00:06:03,936 --> 00:06:09,119
garage side door just start with his there were a couple of regular doctor they just

78
00:06:09,152 --> 00:06:13,567
said old just them go out like you know foot outside the door and then the

79
00:06:13,664 --> 00:06:17,119
step away and cool ups and will come out that I wasn't sure which door to

80
00:06:17,183 --> 00:06:20,447
leave out and he plumped to the front door but if I went to one of

81
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:22,303
the more garage style doors

82
00:06:23,391 --> 00:06:27,615
and because they're the logo was on top of that door and it wasn't only others

83
00:06:27,679 --> 00:06:31,648
but it turned out that actually they meant a regular to all the lodo stuff was

84
00:06:31,839 --> 00:06:36,127
inside of all Susan about the one I had like bars done that were something though

85
00:06:36,256 --> 00:06:39,743
the reason you can really see it which are we seeing if they were fully open

86
00:06:39,808 --> 00:06:41,984
that they probably had the door

87
00:06:43,519 --> 00:06:45,119
yes so it went away fair

88
00:06:47,264 --> 00:06:50,880
about a week and a half and I thought I wouldn't miss it as much as

89
00:06:50,944 --> 00:06:55,200
I did actually but I did miss it quite a lot people of product buiten well

90
00:06:55,839 --> 00:07:00,864
I wanted to make something to my sister birthday and it would be infinitely easier on

91
00:07:00,928 --> 00:07:05,055
an overlock replicate it was being made out of the net fabric it was a cardigan

92
00:07:05,216 --> 00:07:09,440
the bursar Cardin so I got out this card again and every day was like all

93
00:07:09,503 --> 00:07:11,615
that it might be ready so I'll just can hold out

94
00:07:13,696 --> 00:07:17,471
anyway so it turned out I think it was we got a phone call on the

95
00:07:17,536 --> 00:07:22,079
Friday and my sister birthday was on the Tuesday in order to get it there in

96
00:07:22,144 --> 00:07:25,824
time in the post I needed to pick it up on the Saturday morning we picked

97
00:07:25,888 --> 00:07:30,239
it up at lunchtime on the Friday and then stay off the where protest who had

98
00:07:30,303 --> 00:07:34,048
stopped this card again in the probably the fastest I've ever done it they still not

99
00:07:34,111 --> 00:07:38,944
the same god times there in the book for making about the cardigan in the Chilean

100
00:07:39,007 --> 00:07:45,119
buttons look so I'm still wait slower than intend the people who tested these patterns that

101
00:07:45,183 --> 00:07:49,407
anyway I managed to get it done that evening wrapped up and posted which was brilliant

102
00:07:49,567 --> 00:07:55,264
moving on to what went wrong so my theory is that these through was Tyson too

103
00:07:55,391 --> 00:08:01,727
much in the manufacturing process possibly because it just wouldn't budge any we completely mangled this

104
00:08:01,824 --> 00:08:10,111
crude and we will know and I don't think we could have ever what I mean

105
00:08:10,368 --> 00:08:15,615
without any expert help so the theory of the boy who repaired the machine is that

106
00:08:15,679 --> 00:08:16,864
is a rubbish machine

107
00:08:18,463 --> 00:08:22,976
not the best customer service now I mean I can see I guess they obviously repaired

108
00:08:23,007 --> 00:08:27,936
on to defer machines and they also do so machines postindustrial and domestic one is no

109
00:08:28,671 --> 00:08:34,687
and a lot of places to do specializing that don't tend to get these models I

110
00:08:34,783 --> 00:08:36,671
think I got this from answer originally

111
00:08:37,856 --> 00:08:42,559
and it's a singer model it's the vaulting as each seven five for and it still

112
00:08:42,624 --> 00:08:46,271
cost me a couple of and and I think I was on so protesting eight years

113
00:08:46,591 --> 00:08:51,200
but you know it Augusti doesn't have the same reputation as a a enemy

114
00:08:52,288 --> 00:08:57,119
or a dukey model one of the things and store substantial rest of the time for

115
00:08:57,151 --> 00:09:02,656
you know exactly and it's obviously servilely brilliantly over the last eight years and I do

116
00:09:02,719 --> 00:09:07,424
find it interesting they soapy it's a rubbish machine after repairing it and charging me I

117
00:09:07,487 --> 00:09:11,552
could ever see if it was that by the machine he could have asked whether I

118
00:09:11,616 --> 00:09:12,895
wanted to just get a new one

119
00:09:13,952 --> 00:09:14,015
is

120
00:09:15,776 --> 00:09:20,000
fine now and I've been able to use that yes this is the shame will happen

121
00:09:25,184 --> 00:09:29,856
sublates yeah so there you have it there's the story of changing the overlock of lakes

122
00:09:30,559 --> 00:09:34,080
and obviously if someone doesn't know how often you should change the plate at me

123
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:36,000
like

124
00:09:37,952 --> 00:09:39,616
that said for this week thanks for watching
