00:00:00,351 --> 00:00:04,127
hello so today's video is a bit of a catch up Rileys I'm just going to

1
00:00:04,191 --> 00:00:08,864
go through what I've been up to whether I've been meeting any of the goals I

2
00:00:08,991 --> 00:00:13,984
slept for twenty twenty and what I'm looking forward to next as always it's like this

3
00:00:14,048 --> 00:00:17,760
video I want to see more please don't forget to light unsubscribe if you haven't already

4
00:00:18,399 --> 00:00:22,079
I'll begin with what I've been up to you because I can't actually share a lot

5
00:00:22,143 --> 00:00:27,488
of that so there's a special birthday my family coming up it's actually exactly a week

6
00:00:27,648 --> 00:00:34,208
from the day I'm recording and for that I've made quite a challenging project for me

7
00:00:34,335 --> 00:00:40,832
anyway so I've finally finished that earlier this week which I'm really excited about I think

8
00:00:40,863 --> 00:00:45,279
one of the royal thrills I've got is that I've actually finished it with while over

9
00:00:45,312 --> 00:00:49,759
a week to spare which you know there's quite unheard-of with me I have been known

10
00:00:49,888 --> 00:00:56,127
to finish off making gifts on Christmas day while the persons in the room so yeah

11
00:00:56,672 --> 00:01:01,631
I seem to be improving on that respect I used a pattern for this project so

12
00:01:01,951 --> 00:01:06,111
I'll be able to share a pattern review for that and I'll probably schedule that in

13
00:01:06,272 --> 00:01:10,592
for a couple of weeks' time I made an extra Lisl something as well for this

14
00:01:10,655 --> 00:01:15,839
special birthday and I'm going to share that as the tutorial probably nice week apart from

15
00:01:15,903 --> 00:01:22,304
that I've just been cratering in my spare time so I'm working on another long-term project

16
00:01:22,496 --> 00:01:27,776
it's one of my make nine and yeah I'm just calling along without releasing actually over

17
00:01:27,839 --> 00:01:32,639
half way which is excellent I might actually get on to my second yuan based project

18
00:01:32,704 --> 00:01:37,536
for makes mine say that leads me on nicely into progress on my goals so I

19
00:01:37,664 --> 00:01:41,760
thought I just do a better catch up so well almost two months into the year

20
00:01:41,888 --> 00:01:46,879
so it felt like a good time to review what my goals actually were because I'm

21
00:01:46,975 --> 00:01:52,160
one of those people who said guess what I am striving toward if I don't look

22
00:01:52,223 --> 00:01:56,896
at them regularly throughout the year so in times of my make nine I have got

23
00:01:57,087 --> 00:02:01,344
to of my projects done and the third one as I mentioned as a young base

24
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:05,599
though on halfway through that which is brilliant the first project I completed was the two

25
00:02:05,727 --> 00:02:09,888
can talk which I've already shared in a couple of videos on this channel the other

26
00:02:09,983 --> 00:02:15,391
one I will share in a couple of weeks once the recipients has opened their gift

27
00:02:16,031 --> 00:02:19,167
I'm not too sure what I'm going to start next to my make mine I was

28
00:02:19,264 --> 00:02:26,111
going to do the Mina dungarees next however I've got distracted by some other projects which

29
00:02:26,272 --> 00:02:32,095
I will share shortly I may possibly make the friar top because I really want want

30
00:02:32,128 --> 00:02:36,927
to put underneath the pinafores I have and obviously if I do eventually get around to

31
00:02:36,992 --> 00:02:41,151
Mason Mila dungarees I'll have an extra top that will go and meet that another goal

32
00:02:41,216 --> 00:02:45,888
of mine was to get through my mending and to you finally get one of my

33
00:02:46,175 --> 00:02:54,175
shop-bought pinafore dress style garments hand which was brilliant so I'm going to try and crack

34
00:02:54,272 --> 00:02:58,656
on with preparing some other items in the next couple of week another goal was to

35
00:02:59,264 --> 00:03:04,960
get on with making special gifts for the special birthdays which as I've mentioned I'm on

36
00:03:05,055 --> 00:03:09,983
track which is fabulous my final section in this roof video is to tell you what

37
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:13,824
I'm looking forward to and my plans for the next couple of months so I got

38
00:03:13,888 --> 00:03:18,527
this book in the post this week it was a cruel this gift from my sister

39
00:03:18,975 --> 00:03:24,031
which I'm very grateful for so it's the new to me in the buttons book make

40
00:03:24,128 --> 00:03:28,768
it simple and I basically want to make Tom's out with it so I think I

41
00:03:28,863 --> 00:03:34,751
will probably try and do some reviews quite soon so that's my focus over the next

42
00:03:34,848 --> 00:03:39,039
few weeks there's some of the projects in this book as well as lots of good

43
00:03:39,104 --> 00:03:44,160
advice and just some nice quick easy reading as well you know for example we have

44
00:03:44,223 --> 00:03:45,951
got how to make time with the creativity

45
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:48,320
and as

46
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:54,016
as always with the books they got lots of different variations for that pattern so you

47
00:03:54,048 --> 00:04:00,031
know if what some elasticated trousers is the first cousin in the book it's the Sophia

48
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:07,936
trousers but again they show how to make it into a simple comfortable and Harry dungarees

49
00:04:09,343 --> 00:04:14,016
how to put pockets in here there's a couple of different types of pajamas you can

50
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:15,455
make in here so

51
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:21,631
yeah I'm not sure where starkly I was going to try and go methodically through the

52
00:04:21,696 --> 00:04:21,855
book

53
00:04:23,264 --> 00:04:28,223
however I don't think that's going to work for me I might possibly make the cardigan

54
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:32,160
and him fast just because I think it will be the quickest to whip up and

55
00:04:32,287 --> 00:04:32,704
I'm a way

56
00:04:33,791 --> 00:04:38,239
for about a week so I want you to make anything in that time I really

57
00:04:38,272 --> 00:04:43,167
want to make something just before I go away it will of course depend on whether

58
00:04:43,231 --> 00:04:47,712
I have time it is a bowl of other things to prepare for the best day

59
00:04:47,808 --> 00:04:51,648
that's coming up and I've just got to so out my flat as well because what

60
00:04:51,743 --> 00:04:57,055
might be making that other project everything's gonna just got about a while say so it

61
00:04:57,088 --> 00:05:01,791
would be nice to get something done but I'm not sure I may possibly just end

62
00:05:01,855 --> 00:05:06,592
up having enough time to make the sleep mask which has very cute that is the

63
00:05:06,656 --> 00:05:11,295
birth or card again is the one I'd like to make first ideally because I think

64
00:05:11,552 --> 00:05:16,287
I could potentially make it straight away and I have some fabric which I want to

65
00:05:16,351 --> 00:05:20,575
make it out of have this lovely reds net fabric which has a lot of drapes

66
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:25,471
to it as you can see this is the fabric that I meant to make my

67
00:05:26,208 --> 00:05:27,391
Nana cardigan out of

68
00:05:28,575 --> 00:05:34,111
just over a year ago and I accidently cut into the one fabric which you'll probably

69
00:05:34,208 --> 00:05:38,144
be able to hear a brief explanation of in my putter review of the Bibi pinafore

70
00:05:38,528 --> 00:05:44,223
and possibly when I reviewed the kinda cardigan because that's the cardigan that the past and

71
00:05:44,256 --> 00:05:48,320
I used to make her cardigan with but yeah essentially I had to

72
00:05:49,791 --> 00:05:54,399
to fabrics that looked the same or similar color but they were quite different in their

73
00:05:54,463 --> 00:05:56,704
structure of and thickness

74
00:05:57,760 --> 00:06:02,687
and I would have much preferred into barken out there so the best the card again

75
00:06:02,816 --> 00:06:06,335
I think I've got more than enough here I might be able to make to so

76
00:06:06,528 --> 00:06:08,895
perhaps I can a twin it with my sister

77
00:06:09,951 --> 00:06:14,816
we will see but I'll definitely want to give that a game first it's just whether

78
00:06:14,911 --> 00:06:18,847
I can make it before I go away for a week beyond standing to the in

79
00:06:18,911 --> 00:06:24,671
the buttons book I also have a trouser passing cutting course coming up which I'm really

80
00:06:24,735 --> 00:06:28,671
excited about I don't make an offer all the trousers and I don't actually where a

81
00:06:28,735 --> 00:06:33,888
local of trousers I much prefer wearing dresses if I do wear trousers that only something

82
00:06:33,951 --> 00:06:39,071
like jeggings it may be that ready to our trousers all the transit I have tried

83
00:06:39,104 --> 00:06:42,623
to make just on the right cart and I haven't been able to fit it well

84
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:48,447
to myself so it will be really interesting to see how you do adapt

85
00:06:49,503 --> 00:06:55,135
trials a person for yourself because that's definitely a weakness in my sewing I believe that's

86
00:06:55,231 --> 00:06:58,592
how much time and it's over a few weeks because it's in the evening after work

87
00:06:58,944 --> 00:07:02,079
I wouldn't have a pair of Travis at the end or just have a block and

88
00:07:02,144 --> 00:07:08,256
probably I'm a virgin made out calico which I can then adapt to make trousers for

89
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:12,928
myself that's pretty much it for my catch up I hope you've enjoyed this it's just

90
00:07:12,959 --> 00:07:17,216
useful for me to just review where I am and where the is going next week

91
00:07:17,312 --> 00:07:20,511
I plan to be back with a short tutorial for you thanks for watching
