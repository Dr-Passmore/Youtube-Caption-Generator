00:00:00,384 --> 00:00:01,472
when you've mended this one

1
00:00:06,815 --> 00:00:13,696
rattily fine

2
00:00:19,552 --> 00:00:25,087
to me hi this is Phillips arbitrations have a very close in to discussing bending close

3
00:00:25,375 --> 00:00:27,808
in fact she's got a focus on how to repair

4
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:34,976
one of her dresses okay so thank you to fill their his introduction and so yes

5
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:40,159
I am fixing this dress it's been in my repair file for a while part of

6
00:00:40,256 --> 00:00:47,551
my twenty twenty goals sewing wise is to actually repair ice and the clothings and accessories

7
00:00:47,743 --> 00:00:53,248
which need fixing and this is one of them so this is a sort of tunic

8
00:00:53,312 --> 00:01:01,344
dress something I shot but many years ago and it's made in a net fabric but

9
00:01:01,439 --> 00:01:06,944
the problem I have is that the hems come away at the bottom it looks like

10
00:01:07,071 --> 00:01:14,847
they used a blind hemstitch so instead of trying to do a zigzag stitch or twin

11
00:01:14,944 --> 00:01:19,903
needle or I do have a cover stitch Mr scene which would probably be the most

12
00:01:19,968 --> 00:01:26,111
professional looking finish but there was never any stitching really visible in the outside when

13
00:01:27,232 --> 00:01:31,776
the original stitching walls present there's a tiny bit of it left which is how I've

14
00:01:31,872 --> 00:01:35,839
worked out how they did it and here you can't see the stitching on the outside

15
00:01:35,903 --> 00:01:39,295
so what I'm going to do is actually learn how to use the blind hemstitch on

16
00:01:39,424 --> 00:01:44,928
my regular sewing machine and I thought I'd share that in today's video now it's worth

17
00:01:45,024 --> 00:01:51,263
bearing in mind that I am using black threads and this garment is predominantly black though

18
00:01:51,456 --> 00:01:56,671
it may not show that well so perhaps I'll add in some clips of how to

19
00:01:56,736 --> 00:02:05,664
use the blind hamfat with a contrast fabric just to show how the stitch works because

20
00:02:06,239 --> 00:02:10,272
theoretically you shouldn't be able to say all this because I'm mending it as always if

21
00:02:10,304 --> 00:02:14,591
you like this video please don't forget to like and subscribe if you haven't already I

22
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:20,160
have my machine Peri threaded his so I've got black thread in the bobbin I've got

23
00:02:20,255 --> 00:02:26,143
black thread in the school at the top and I've put what I believe to be

24
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:30,464
the blind hamfat on so it's got a little gauge at the side which you can

25
00:02:30,591 --> 00:02:36,255
move with this style and on the right hand side so I've moved it to where

26
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:42,048
I think it should work okay see the advantage with this short but item is that

27
00:02:42,656 --> 00:02:47,488
it's got a very distinctly pressed him already so that hasn't disappeared

28
00:02:48,511 --> 00:02:51,296
so I don't need to go to my iron and press that

29
00:02:52,895 --> 00:02:53,632
in order to

30
00:02:54,815 --> 00:02:57,311
create this line ten what I'm going to do

31
00:02:58,335 --> 00:03:02,591
is with the inside of the dress showing so I can see all the scenes on

32
00:03:02,656 --> 00:03:05,119
the inside I'm then going to

33
00:03:06,432 --> 00:03:08,895
flip the press him

34
00:03:10,175 --> 00:03:10,464
over

35
00:03:13,311 --> 00:03:14,143
so that I'm

36
00:03:15,296 --> 00:03:16,768
I've now got a fold

37
00:03:18,688 --> 00:03:20,128
but I'm going to leave enough

38
00:03:22,975 --> 00:03:23,520
of that

39
00:03:24,992 --> 00:03:26,656
actual edge showing

40
00:03:27,968 --> 00:03:32,511
on the side so the overlocked edge is still there then I've got a bit of

41
00:03:32,576 --> 00:03:35,039
fabric and then I've got the folded edge

42
00:03:36,223 --> 00:03:38,688
next to it so I'm pretty gonna start a bit over from

43
00:03:40,223 --> 00:03:44,832
that seem that because I might find that a bit too tricky to get over

44
00:03:46,559 --> 00:03:49,919
and I'm gonna leave a little gap just because I'm worried that if I

45
00:03:51,391 --> 00:03:52,352
don't leave enough

46
00:03:54,207 --> 00:03:58,175
of an edge hear the stitch you might go off the side and I want it

47
00:03:58,240 --> 00:04:04,160
to still pick up on the machine so for my machine I've got the soup teens

48
00:04:04,223 --> 00:04:07,231
thirty for on this machine it is

49
00:04:08,384 --> 00:04:14,944
a its number nine that essentially you're creating a line or stitching which will be on

50
00:04:15,007 --> 00:04:17,951
this single layer of fabric here

51
00:04:19,104 --> 00:04:25,407
but then the odd stitch will just catch on to the folded bit of fabric to

52
00:04:25,471 --> 00:04:29,631
secure it and then you do a couple more stitches on this bit then it will

53
00:04:29,696 --> 00:04:30,208
catch again

54
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:36,191
which will theoretically give it a blind him but you do need to make sure that

55
00:04:36,287 --> 00:04:41,216
only just catches on the fold of the fabric so that's where I might need to

56
00:04:43,264 --> 00:04:47,839
test it and it may be a bit of trial and error I put quite wide

57
00:04:47,967 --> 00:04:53,055
stitch length on her so I've put is nearly three or my machine just because it

58
00:04:53,152 --> 00:04:57,471
is a fairly thick net fabric but I'm going to see how it goes it might

59
00:04:57,536 --> 00:05:02,720
be that this is a to wider stitch I can't adjust the width on my machine

60
00:05:02,847 --> 00:05:03,391
for this so

61
00:05:04,768 --> 00:05:05,727
hope that it should be fine

62
00:05:08,768 --> 00:05:11,679
and care about a quick go I think it might be a bit too

63
00:05:14,368 --> 00:05:19,872
far over so I'm going to roll so that this gauge meeds a bit over so

64
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:25,247
so they should push this fabric so it's not as far over

65
00:05:26,272 --> 00:05:27,231
which should mean that

66
00:05:28,799 --> 00:05:34,783
the stitch isn't so far in and should not be as visible on the other side

67
00:06:10,208 --> 00:06:14,816
so I've gone all the way around now I'm really happy with that him results

68
00:06:15,872 --> 00:06:20,096
it's funny because I've never really thought about using a blind him on a net fabric

69
00:06:20,223 --> 00:06:25,088
but having had a look up it looks like it is a good alternative if you

70
00:06:25,279 --> 00:06:30,144
don't want a visible him and especially with this sort of fabric it you know even

71
00:06:30,239 --> 00:06:35,328
this light stitch doesn't show through but even when I haven't done it

72
00:06:36,544 --> 00:06:40,799
even when I've done it so that it's a bit more visible because I'm still learning

73
00:06:40,864 --> 00:06:45,216
how to do the stitch on this it's very forgiving because it's such a busy pattern

74
00:06:45,855 --> 00:06:49,023
and but that's great so that should secure it now I should be able to wear

75
00:06:49,119 --> 00:06:53,664
it again and because that was all that was stopping me wearing this so I'm going

76
00:06:53,696 --> 00:06:57,343
to give it a quick press just to press it back down properly but

77
00:06:58,432 --> 00:07:02,911
it looks like it's nice and secure again just in case you couldn't see what I

78
00:07:02,944 --> 00:07:08,544
was doing I've got a bit of the scrap of the red Terry cloth that's going

79
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:16,415
absolutely everyone so so this was the him so if I pressed up that amount so

80
00:07:16,768 --> 00:07:20,768
I've got my folded up him here but I want it as a blind him I

81
00:07:20,895 --> 00:07:22,783
did then press that bit

82
00:07:24,287 --> 00:07:28,480
underneath but have a bit of a bit of that raw edge showing

83
00:07:30,911 --> 00:07:33,183
will then line this folded section

84
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:40,928
where that gauge is if you've got this otherwise I guess you just put it fairly

85
00:07:41,119 --> 00:07:41,664
in the middle

86
00:07:43,231 --> 00:07:47,455
and then yeah if you've got it on the blind hemstitch it should then

87
00:07:56,063 --> 00:07:58,976
so you can see it's visible on the inside

88
00:08:00,832 --> 00:08:04,287
it's a bit hard to tell on the start loss to be honest and you can

89
00:08:04,415 --> 00:08:10,368
see it where I've stitched it with it folded over but on the outside it's not

90
00:08:10,432 --> 00:08:14,528
really was bored or you can see the odd catch and that is because I have

91
00:08:14,623 --> 00:08:21,791
used a black thread on purpose to show so depending how much that little I'm sigs

92
00:08:21,824 --> 00:08:28,032
like stitch juts out into your fabric will determine how long the blind him shows how

93
00:08:28,287 --> 00:08:35,231
long that stitch shows on the outside okay so that's my dress or repaired so as

94
00:08:35,296 --> 00:08:41,247
you can see the hem those look pretty much invisible you can kind of see us

95
00:08:41,375 --> 00:08:49,408
like indent where and the stitches have been added but it's probably where they were once

96
00:08:49,504 --> 00:08:49,695
where

97
00:08:50,943 --> 00:08:55,263
I've stitched a bit too far over into that fold and I think with time and

98
00:08:55,328 --> 00:08:59,296
practice I could make much better job of this but because this fabric is so busy

99
00:08:59,872 --> 00:09:05,247
I'm not going to undo it on this occasion but perhaps next time there him goes

100
00:09:05,536 --> 00:09:10,687
I will be a lot better at it so you have just given a better pressed

101
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:17,247
so I've never used the blind ten-foot or used the blind him function at all on

102
00:09:17,343 --> 00:09:21,952
my machine and I'm pleased to say it wasn't as difficult as I thought it would

103
00:09:22,047 --> 00:09:26,176
be so I would recommend it and it looks like it does work quite well with

104
00:09:26,271 --> 00:09:31,424
nets as well which I wasn't aware of that looking online it does look like it

105
00:09:31,487 --> 00:09:32,799
is a good option if you

106
00:09:33,984 --> 00:09:37,504
do want to use it for that so that's it for this week thanks for watching
