0
00:00:01,055 --> 00:00:02,720
high and welcome back

1
00:00:04,096 --> 00:00:06,559
well it's mean a while has not it definitely

2
00:00:08,352 --> 00:00:10,336
so we just that we do a great kept up

3
00:00:12,447 --> 00:00:13,791
didn't happen intransigeant to what

4
00:00:14,847 --> 00:00:19,072
what we plan to do that share and these things we'd be working on currently

5
00:00:20,639 --> 00:00:24,416
you may have noticed to play a drop of requested the just move the last year

6
00:00:25,791 --> 00:00:34,816
yeah so I think twins twenty what was the constant

7
00:00:41,599 --> 00:00:42,495
was hoping to but that

8
00:00:43,776 --> 00:00:48,000
didn't have another video ready well I think ready I'd edited the actual footage and I

9
00:00:48,063 --> 00:00:52,895
needed to revise soma by distinct it around to works in time and it was Christmas

10
00:00:52,959 --> 00:00:54,368
seemed so I'm not into place to get

11
00:00:55,391 --> 00:01:00,895
the kick and wait until it gets yeah pretty much so um yeah addrest matawan so

12
00:01:02,304 --> 00:01:06,751
yeah not a lot happened and its kind of reflective from the lack of videos so

13
00:01:07,328 --> 00:01:08,223
to get a few things

14
00:01:10,624 --> 00:01:12,096
I want for Christmas

15
00:01:13,375 --> 00:01:14,080
made a pot holder

16
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:16,896
my sister the

17
00:01:19,519 --> 00:01:24,064
so we got you listen things done I get my new Christian night like which by

18
00:01:24,192 --> 00:01:25,503
doing place of a Christmas card

19
00:01:26,688 --> 00:01:27,935
my Christmas so that that

20
00:01:29,856 --> 00:01:35,136
but apart from that Oh yeah just a day jobs kind of dominated a lot of

21
00:01:35,167 --> 00:01:39,872
the year so be a lot of changes in my role in particular and then even

22
00:01:39,903 --> 00:01:42,847
more recently and your changed as well

23
00:01:44,223 --> 00:01:49,536
so that's kind of effectives other areas of our lives over the last year

24
00:01:50,847 --> 00:01:56,096
also just work in remote leaves though we're both still predominantly remote working

25
00:01:57,472 --> 00:01:59,328
and to various degrees and to stretchable

26
00:02:00,416 --> 00:02:02,400
mean it's like less than you bet

27
00:02:03,424 --> 00:02:08,192
and that's a greasy had an impact that actually I mean we have essentially been up

28
00:02:08,255 --> 00:02:14,175
remain working since we saw this global event and why been in I think it was

29
00:02:14,207 --> 00:02:20,608
having an eleven days in Cato at this point since all and kept on the rest

30
00:02:20,639 --> 00:02:20,927
of us on

31
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:32,095
beriberi the different points so and but still had an impact on on where we live

32
00:02:32,192 --> 00:02:35,328
so we live in a black it's not huge its

33
00:02:37,024 --> 00:02:42,432
tiny but it's not a huge sighed I got so that's that's all resee affected our

34
00:02:42,464 --> 00:02:43,744
productivity at home so

35
00:02:44,768 --> 00:02:46,111
pretty I've had to

36
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:53,216
essentially move that the table I used to craft on and on can ask there instead

37
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:57,408
and have all my work here there and which is fine it's a little bit with

38
00:02:57,503 --> 00:03:00,639
because I'm to abort the start but and

39
00:03:01,856 --> 00:03:06,815
for you made a an overhead camera like a roadie high one just a little local

40
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:12,735
to see one mother yeah so uses to camera motile I think she's Pizer right so

41
00:03:13,695 --> 00:03:18,304
yeah it did the job by yourself directly above the craft as I can attach to

42
00:03:18,367 --> 00:03:18,720
receive or

43
00:03:21,216 --> 00:03:21,759
it's still there

44
00:03:22,783 --> 00:03:28,095
yes I say we can easily get some footage and the winter in the day they

45
00:03:28,192 --> 00:03:31,744
want to be fair I thought quite nice keep on it like it's no to college

46
00:03:31,807 --> 00:03:35,328
isn't it the lights on it say so that looks quite pretty but you know not

47
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:40,384
very practical for making any craft videos or documenting anything do apart from work

48
00:03:41,632 --> 00:03:46,688
Sarah yeso not very as we made it somewhere so my list of things to do

49
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:50,751
my god to repurpose that scientists call she be

50
00:03:54,783 --> 00:03:55,039
over the

51
00:03:56,223 --> 00:03:59,328
people at the peacocks clear to come

52
00:04:02,527 --> 00:04:02,623
so

53
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:08,255
anyway so that that hasn't helped and I think so then we moved my craft table

54
00:04:08,384 --> 00:04:12,800
into the living area so it's in this room and we just found that for I

55
00:04:12,895 --> 00:04:17,984
found that it it just wasn't working out because and the way we had this from

56
00:04:18,048 --> 00:04:22,432
arranged I was just it was in the corner of my eye the whole time so

57
00:04:22,559 --> 00:04:27,488
and be saying watching TV but then I could see the table the craft table also

58
00:04:27,615 --> 00:04:33,343
machine subtle not being aged yeah I just had already demotivate him just to sink in

59
00:04:33,407 --> 00:04:36,832
yet I'm not crofting at the moment and it just looked really not see

60
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:43,903
you could just see it you know it's it's obviously not as especially designed graph table

61
00:04:43,936 --> 00:04:44,415
once it's

62
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:47,231
a dining table that someone gave us

63
00:04:48,671 --> 00:04:53,119
you know so you can see everything underneath that and yeah just like to mass really

64
00:04:54,559 --> 00:05:00,223
so what we have done actually which we do that the start this year is move

65
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:05,791
around this great you say we were so she flipped them already having good and it

66
00:05:05,855 --> 00:05:09,824
means that now the craft table instead of being kind of in front of us when

67
00:05:10,079 --> 00:05:13,407
we're sitting on the sofa like we are now it's actually over to the side so

68
00:05:13,824 --> 00:05:19,231
is common room dividers one yeah just the other side of the room divide up from

69
00:05:19,295 --> 00:05:24,511
the widow with turn my mom covered with this a very gravely orange rather at home

70
00:05:26,239 --> 00:05:29,696
but the last sentence we don't need to see get we did have it without there

71
00:05:29,727 --> 00:05:33,376
in the wider result for readily than me and that works quite well as well me

72
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:37,920
I think just because it's there rather than in front it just it makes the world

73
00:05:37,984 --> 00:05:42,944
of difference so fingers crossed that will actually have an impact on on feeling way to

74
00:05:42,976 --> 00:05:44,256
a way to the to practice well

75
00:05:46,687 --> 00:05:47,359
yeah well

76
00:05:50,239 --> 00:05:53,407
you got new ever have camera there as well so well almost

77
00:05:54,528 --> 00:05:59,007
needs to be attached to the season gone beyond it as I struggled to get me

78
00:05:59,071 --> 00:06:03,743
well attached to the thing property not know I don't think so he's quite happening so

79
00:06:04,447 --> 00:06:08,511
rarely by for her the Michael to come in the close cropped it lends too worried

80
00:06:08,575 --> 00:06:10,303
about the weight of it I just want the because

81
00:06:11,488 --> 00:06:14,783
we've ended up I mean I can't remember when you made the head while that we

82
00:06:14,847 --> 00:06:20,384
haven't used it for many videos no in the end but I guess the main drawback

83
00:06:20,447 --> 00:06:23,936
from that as you can't knew that once you are touched it essentially the way we

84
00:06:24,384 --> 00:06:28,063
we did it was we just like packs and screams and listening like you like follow

85
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:33,440
wall once and schedule but I mean it is quite easy sickout this even though we

86
00:06:33,503 --> 00:06:34,656
just need to patch up the whole spit

87
00:06:36,032 --> 00:06:40,032
I'm not sure I feel like picking wobbles in the singly just rushes we have munched

88
00:06:40,096 --> 00:06:43,808
but on a tripod fairly high the main issues if we wanted to get a shot

89
00:06:43,839 --> 00:06:44,544
of the whole table

90
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:50,239
where we could get different mentally exactly say that might do it and we might go

91
00:06:50,272 --> 00:06:51,584
up to put the tripod up slightly higher

92
00:06:56,544 --> 00:07:06,656
than playing around though we were reviewing your living situation as well sick so as we

93
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:13,503
mentioned space of the premium hand so we were looking around see those of escape

94
00:07:14,623 --> 00:07:21,600
possibly going somewhere those but in the end we've decided to sell put answers just maybe

95
00:07:21,696 --> 00:07:27,584
reconsider fraction of this place I'm have a better reject especially with the cost of living

96
00:07:27,936 --> 00:07:29,440
duty gastronomically

97
00:07:31,584 --> 00:07:35,391
well we're okay here really only one be financially Sajid so

98
00:07:36,832 --> 00:07:41,023
make risking a large pot to her finding that because Louis karakas

99
00:07:42,528 --> 00:07:48,160
way to do and it's quite an efficient I could that is or is a flax

100
00:07:48,671 --> 00:07:50,847
you know it's quite well insulated

101
00:07:51,872 --> 00:07:52,575
it's a nourisher

102
00:07:54,656 --> 00:07:57,536
it means that we've got the benefits of modern insulations

103
00:07:58,592 --> 00:08:01,055
free means that Albert was hopefully wake up too much

104
00:08:03,264 --> 00:08:04,575
that's pretty much

105
00:08:05,727 --> 00:08:09,951
that's pretty much ten-ten one is not as they will show that are mine

106
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:15,839
so be about what we're currently done so

107
00:08:17,119 --> 00:08:22,111
me pass so I've just finished a couple of some products which I didn't expect to

108
00:08:22,496 --> 00:08:26,911
say so bittering out the new aircraft face in it and I've made a couple of

109
00:08:26,976 --> 00:08:32,736
prayer tops now I want the fabric in October when we distance and family in Bristol

110
00:08:33,023 --> 00:08:36,640
it do and to the focal Linda and I got there I took a chance on

111
00:08:36,768 --> 00:08:41,343
this white fabric so it's a stretch fabric but it had that sort of unknown quantities

112
00:08:41,408 --> 00:08:46,432
in it so I just so I wanted some more frail tops that were white because

113
00:08:46,495 --> 00:08:51,359
I like glaring them with with my many pantoufles and so I cut that out the

114
00:08:51,424 --> 00:08:56,096
very start of January I believe that really just finished the two last week

115
00:08:57,856 --> 00:09:00,864
it's nice to finally finished address he can project because it has been a very long

116
00:09:00,927 --> 00:09:01,088
top

117
00:09:02,495 --> 00:09:03,744
yeso those two hadn't

118
00:09:04,864 --> 00:09:08,223
put from that probably being focused on the on this project so

119
00:09:09,567 --> 00:09:14,335
so at the at some point in twins twenty one I was talking to I'm saying

120
00:09:14,463 --> 00:09:18,015
I have lips this I'm sorry project so I made this

121
00:09:19,039 --> 00:09:23,776
year's dinner all started at a few years again and it was a way to use

122
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:26,591
up a lot of my wall as I have so much and I were to the

123
00:09:26,624 --> 00:09:33,056
way to reduce astonish so I started this three hundred seventy it's one present throat and

124
00:09:33,088 --> 00:09:37,919
eventually finished that it's full keep random assortment of follows is just what I had to

125
00:09:37,984 --> 00:09:38,208
nose

126
00:09:39,359 --> 00:09:43,231
and said ammono was like well you could make part of me because you need that

127
00:09:43,296 --> 00:09:46,880
I didn't want to make another one for I have because as I mentioned burns not

128
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:49,856
if you don't need more than one through really I guess we can't put one on

129
00:09:49,888 --> 00:09:55,039
the onto the raft about the here so I think the other problem as well as

130
00:09:55,072 --> 00:09:58,752
it be hard to make one that match this because it was a whole random it's

131
00:09:58,783 --> 00:10:04,736
still minimal sacred yeah so yeah so she went Oh you can make me a throat

132
00:10:04,768 --> 00:10:09,599
for my sofa so she ordered some more and I've been making some Swiss for that

133
00:10:10,239 --> 00:10:11,231
by the next few months

134
00:10:12,255 --> 00:10:15,744
so on this new through it's not going to be a random as this it at

135
00:10:15,807 --> 00:10:20,159
clovery because she's ordered the wall and the things sorted like six or seven dollars to

136
00:10:20,799 --> 00:10:24,864
its I'm not going to be as random to think that more about the layout once

137
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:28,671
I've done it but yes so I've been enjoying doing that and it's a nice possible

138
00:10:28,703 --> 00:10:32,544
one so if we are troubling I can easily open in the Bible bring it with

139
00:10:32,607 --> 00:10:32,671
me

140
00:10:33,791 --> 00:10:39,263
the other projector head is I've started a project that my dad's requested so dad if

141
00:10:39,328 --> 00:10:41,919
you are watching please stop watching their

142
00:10:43,104 --> 00:10:44,096
ways it was full of this cries

143
00:10:45,471 --> 00:10:51,776
and yes I

144
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:58,111
not watching that but some yes so I have slaughtered making a jumper which she was

145
00:10:58,176 --> 00:11:03,776
requested so about maybe a month or two for Christmas he went Oh you know what

146
00:11:03,807 --> 00:11:08,288
I'd really like you to it next time you know like for Christmas summer is I'm

147
00:11:08,544 --> 00:11:08,927
a jumper

148
00:11:10,015 --> 00:11:13,504
I gotta love because I'm I'm very slow and after I know some people can live

149
00:11:14,015 --> 00:11:18,495
and it's something in that like six weeks you know people quicker I mean to be

150
00:11:18,559 --> 00:11:20,064
fair this are called to him and were now

151
00:11:21,888 --> 00:11:23,168
my mom might and

152
00:11:24,416 --> 00:11:30,815
remember it was not having less than two weeks because I'm yes she basically started making

153
00:11:30,976 --> 00:11:35,872
it the couple of weeks before my back and managed to mention it all which is

154
00:11:35,903 --> 00:11:38,783
something I definitely can't do but she is a very fast

155
00:11:40,383 --> 00:11:43,135
it's yeso so I have to him and said

156
00:11:44,607 --> 00:11:48,927
I thought he's talking about and the Christmas is just the past it was like yeah

157
00:11:49,056 --> 00:11:51,711
that's not get happen it was like well would take it be a lead time of

158
00:11:51,744 --> 00:11:51,968
the year

159
00:11:53,375 --> 00:11:57,247
might get round to up and get on the moment and of his measurements either so

160
00:11:57,343 --> 00:12:02,591
as to he was even more music but anyway I ended up going as measurements roughly

161
00:12:02,656 --> 00:12:08,064
at some point Harmon the went but I've started making the doctor's though and it's actually

162
00:12:08,127 --> 00:12:10,943
from the Princeton I found in one of this weekly so

163
00:12:12,223 --> 00:12:18,848
our local library and the app they've got their digital magazines and they must be subscripted

164
00:12:19,104 --> 00:12:23,263
which was willing so we did a search for a bit Mr temple something and it

165
00:12:23,328 --> 00:12:24,895
came up for it might be Mrs Spencer

166
00:12:26,047 --> 00:12:29,536
because it's bit more burst tough and so I found this one is here I believe

167
00:12:29,599 --> 00:12:30,848
it's not a certain the sleeves

168
00:12:32,479 --> 00:12:37,471
and it's not quite an interesting color that important hi it's quite simple because I haven't

169
00:12:37,536 --> 00:12:41,888
made something quite this big before I don't want anything that was too involved

170
00:12:43,104 --> 00:12:46,304
so as you can see I'm still on the back place still wear

171
00:12:47,359 --> 00:12:51,744
slowly getting the rooms down on it but to be far I'm willing drawing it this

172
00:12:51,807 --> 00:12:56,288
is quite a life school that I found in them as well me there's a couple

173
00:12:56,320 --> 00:13:00,927
of all shops and Dallas now but this is just from them for local shop I

174
00:13:01,023 --> 00:13:05,728
wasn't too expensive this wall I don't want to get anything too expensive Bachofen bruine and

175
00:13:05,791 --> 00:13:09,343
I also want to sat quite easy to watch I'm so but he don't have to

176
00:13:09,375 --> 00:13:14,559
wear about the the wash cabinet so ye so that's my progress and master

177
00:13:15,968 --> 00:13:22,015
yes cut of aiming for this Christmas issue but at least wearing in the

178
00:13:23,104 --> 00:13:28,223
mid fabaceae you think is cursed I can get everything else done on this jumper bottle

179
00:13:28,288 --> 00:13:28,416
then

180
00:13:30,239 --> 00:13:31,744
I think that's my project

181
00:13:39,648 --> 00:13:41,984
the tracks kids the cattle

182
00:13:47,776 --> 00:13:51,616
it's not too much as this couple of the electric certain things to come in the

183
00:13:51,679 --> 00:13:57,888
camp beds again it's finally time to sit down and stop and settle over and Kaden

184
00:13:58,752 --> 00:14:00,831
doctor but as Peter is not around this one

185
00:14:02,176 --> 00:14:18,400
Testament's twenty-twenty say we all go to try and focus on doing to the sewing electronics

186
00:14:18,943 --> 00:14:24,096
just because of it kind of Mary's up while table is quite nicely to quite from

187
00:14:25,471 --> 00:14:26,080
it is a bit of

188
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:33,375
you got a technical challenge of travel sackett's fabric was keeping it is

189
00:14:43,135 --> 00:14:47,968
so the only one the only project that we've shared so far the even Donte project

190
00:14:48,064 --> 00:14:53,567
that we should one of them and one twin twenty-one biddy and it is the lead

191
00:14:53,728 --> 00:14:55,648
but mark and all that

192
00:14:56,736 --> 00:15:00,031
yeah we had to find a nice aesthetically pleasing

193
00:15:01,856 --> 00:15:05,760
it was also a request the design firm money so is making it was making it

194
00:15:05,888 --> 00:15:11,583
for my niece and and I asked my sister you know what would my knees like

195
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:12,895
of the design and she's

196
00:15:14,271 --> 00:15:18,239
we then had to work out how to create a castle design that worked with the

197
00:15:18,656 --> 00:15:21,312
ends on the circuit part that

198
00:15:26,783 --> 00:15:30,559
is that what was next and only so we were kind of facing it off them

199
00:15:31,487 --> 00:15:32,768
this is a good similar

200
00:15:35,648 --> 00:15:38,463
yes there's a really good but I think it's out of print now but they do

201
00:15:38,591 --> 00:15:41,408
have a website and that you can't is it

202
00:15:42,495 --> 00:15:46,880
really handy website which showed you how you can make a simple bookmark but it is

203
00:15:46,976 --> 00:15:48,671
very basic and on felt

204
00:15:50,047 --> 00:15:53,791
and for this kind of tickets we don't want the battery exposed the Ficino many season

205
00:15:53,856 --> 00:15:59,072
the old we wanted the battery pack hidden just cause firstly it will ruin the book

206
00:15:59,135 --> 00:16:01,375
as much and a second it would mean that

207
00:16:03,039 --> 00:16:05,343
we don't have to integrate it into the design

208
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:08,383
of it on the outside

209
00:16:09,408 --> 00:16:13,216
but yeah the problem with that was that that's like an on-off switch on the one

210
00:16:13,247 --> 00:16:17,664
the battery pack and you know that would have been very practical for my niece very

211
00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:24,575
food lieutenant to be what it wasn't that while the end of used the fresh pot

212
00:16:24,640 --> 00:16:28,512
of billions of the sin of challenges that we need to address some of our other

213
00:16:29,599 --> 00:16:32,671
plans for projects that would like to make that there's like

214
00:16:33,919 --> 00:16:40,479
got a Christmas catchers gravitic kind of have made for the mother's what film enlisted to

215
00:16:40,544 --> 00:16:44,096
vis-a-vis in the design or recruit leaders design and

216
00:16:45,280 --> 00:16:50,047
one it's Christmas I mean actually we make this fraction from from my or best thinking

217
00:16:50,143 --> 00:16:54,304
here but will record it where I had actually get it out for December and then

218
00:16:54,367 --> 00:16:57,567
we never ended up doing it I did edit all the message but I needed to

219
00:16:57,632 --> 00:17:00,927
do a voice-over to explain and I have a brownstone that

220
00:17:02,176 --> 00:17:09,024
the gods contrasting is more three dimensional missed its say the preaching of the battery a

221
00:17:09,215 --> 00:17:12,511
little living and the branches had been hidden away

222
00:17:13,567 --> 00:17:13,952
secured

223
00:17:16,095 --> 00:17:20,160
they were conducted through it into any de grantor actual trigger was

224
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:25,952
making a wall were also not really much as we were going to make it a

225
00:17:25,984 --> 00:17:30,047
retired to build a thing having it designed in a way where you could recharge the

226
00:17:30,112 --> 00:17:32,000
batteries

227
00:17:33,696 --> 00:17:34,656
and actually charges

228
00:17:37,536 --> 00:17:40,287
be as interesting as for coming from teeter for the points on it

229
00:17:41,920 --> 00:17:46,047
soon yeah that was an interesting product that we didn't end up share but I think

230
00:17:46,144 --> 00:17:52,447
we might end up completely rerecording it because I'm making another one because there were elements

231
00:17:52,576 --> 00:17:57,151
that you only really learned to go and so actually there would be better were done

232
00:17:57,439 --> 00:17:58,816
this this all the way

233
00:17:59,839 --> 00:18:03,423
even from the sewing point of view that you know like the soso with the reader

234
00:18:03,807 --> 00:18:08,255
back and I realized that I shouldn't have cut out the antlers as to individual little

235
00:18:08,319 --> 00:18:12,447
pieces it would be a little scared for just cast out the whole of the Rudolph

236
00:18:12,735 --> 00:18:17,696
shaped heads with the others just stuck it to the back or them because it was

237
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:19,968
a different color to the face of Rudolph

238
00:18:21,183 --> 00:18:24,511
I should have done on which you know if we will call that I've been do

239
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:28,223
it without like the way that I now think would be busted to I mean among

240
00:18:28,287 --> 00:18:32,319
at work better but well we'll only find out if we did right

241
00:18:34,527 --> 00:18:40,479
yes that can be quite as for twenty Quincy sea and the silent videos my change

242
00:18:40,543 --> 00:18:45,984
about as all right dislike we mentioned got a different overhead camera start a high-quality so

243
00:18:46,079 --> 00:18:51,167
I can that can be really good to any storages or clicking storages course once following

244
00:18:51,232 --> 00:18:53,599
along you be really clearly see everything

245
00:18:55,744 --> 00:18:56,416
wiring

246
00:18:59,712 --> 00:18:59,839
that

247
00:19:01,536 --> 00:19:02,303
really nice quality

248
00:19:05,791 --> 00:19:10,816
but with earth with a new son to be different tamarillos and this Lismore the practicalities

249
00:19:10,911 --> 00:19:12,735
in just the filmmaking process

250
00:19:13,952 --> 00:19:18,848
yes so only first me to see the school we had done we are and you

251
00:19:18,911 --> 00:19:22,495
could go out the side of this table or the long ends that way and which

252
00:19:22,560 --> 00:19:26,047
meant that we could just take a camera in the front and you know have one

253
00:19:26,112 --> 00:19:29,248
of the sides kind of angled to the side I think we used to have it

254
00:19:30,336 --> 00:19:34,271
on the window and quarter to do the overhead and then we had them

255
00:19:35,359 --> 00:19:38,943
but Amery's now just straight on as we do now that we should have only at

256
00:19:38,975 --> 00:19:42,271
the side of the table so what we used to do is just don't think up

257
00:19:42,495 --> 00:19:46,911
the audio one base and then we'd just like cut away to the different angles and

258
00:19:46,943 --> 00:19:49,823
then when it looked best but we're not going to be up to do that because

259
00:19:49,887 --> 00:19:53,791
it's against the Warner I'm just because it works better for the space

260
00:19:55,104 --> 00:19:57,984
so they won't be any like head on shots but to be on a something for

261
00:19:58,015 --> 00:19:59,391
love tutorials you don't need that

262
00:20:00,447 --> 00:20:03,839
wanting to be a great interest to districts wearing was just how to film in this

263
00:20:03,904 --> 00:20:05,343
new sat up know

264
00:20:06,943 --> 00:20:12,767
what I'm doing bulletin that we don't need a better your je-sus yeah exactly so that

265
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:13,280
should be fun

266
00:20:14,432 --> 00:20:21,183
I think the Kennebec test out these different angles is them I'm going to see the

267
00:20:21,248 --> 00:20:24,160
hundred a project again to me to take a break class Jan was it a

268
00:20:25,215 --> 00:20:29,823
lot of huge what happened punster and I'm going to do a hundred days architects old

269
00:20:29,887 --> 00:20:34,719
cards so ability was a bit different to the hundred days of free machine embroidery amyls

270
00:20:35,199 --> 00:20:39,744
I'm not going to necessarily record every day I might record about if every day but

271
00:20:39,776 --> 00:20:42,975
I'm not necessarily gonna use all the footage I'm just going to do a bit of

272
00:20:43,040 --> 00:20:47,264
a collage or a summary video every ten days so

273
00:20:49,855 --> 00:20:50,911
I'm gonna combine

274
00:20:52,576 --> 00:20:58,432
so happy ten video is essentially or ten Instagram and posts and I'll put the ten

275
00:20:58,687 --> 00:21:01,472
different costs I end up making on that

276
00:21:02,816 --> 00:21:07,008
just because it would just make it a bit less time intensive I think especially with

277
00:21:07,104 --> 00:21:09,791
the animals it was quite simple was very formal back

278
00:21:10,911 --> 00:21:15,296
the worked well but text on cards it is a bit more burst style and I

279
00:21:15,391 --> 00:21:18,784
haven't planned it as much tools to last time I had landed animals planned to the

280
00:21:18,816 --> 00:21:22,271
box than I and I used to shake the books that leads to pick out a

281
00:21:22,432 --> 00:21:25,696
round of the speaker in that time of which animal is doing Monday so then I'd

282
00:21:25,728 --> 00:21:28,671
still have to look up the animal and to sketch out the design of tracer and

283
00:21:28,895 --> 00:21:32,895
stick gesso still a log work on the day but this time I have landed at

284
00:21:32,959 --> 00:21:37,375
all but all the cards I've got a few ideas so you know any wonder into

285
00:21:37,407 --> 00:21:41,024
deep today which is good to cut any to go after this and then I'm you

286
00:21:41,088 --> 00:21:45,151
know I've got a couple of other Eitan's I'm just because I'm there are some other

287
00:21:45,183 --> 00:21:48,447
cards I need to make for other people the other advantage of

288
00:21:50,271 --> 00:21:55,072
grouping together the card since they are making individual videos or post silence crammers that I

289
00:21:55,199 --> 00:22:00,352
can make cards and four people will turn this time period so for example when you

290
00:22:00,416 --> 00:22:03,232
know there are a couple of birthdays coming up and of the same other and Sunday

291
00:22:05,439 --> 00:22:07,680
things like that and it just means that I can

292
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:13,599
create Kant's for people as well it won't me get a bit ahead on worldmaking I

293
00:22:13,696 --> 00:22:15,615
tend to make carts rather than purchase them

294
00:22:16,703 --> 00:22:19,264
but I always seem to leave at the last minute some time and this will get

295
00:22:19,328 --> 00:22:24,095
me really all the nicer to and I stop what parts but the and hundred thanks

296
00:22:24,608 --> 00:22:29,504
to all and it is not going to be exclusively free which you can birders we

297
00:22:29,567 --> 00:22:33,663
are doing a bit of traveling it were going away twice during the hundred-day parent at

298
00:22:33,728 --> 00:22:35,423
least so I'm going to

299
00:22:37,024 --> 00:22:41,183
especially for one of them I definitely could bring his own machine say I'm going to

300
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:43,615
leave it open said I can do things like hand embroidery

301
00:22:45,823 --> 00:22:50,368
you know the things that I can paint texted you know different textiles offices so like

302
00:22:50,432 --> 00:22:56,063
you to the burn into it and these different techniques reversed Peking of the king

303
00:22:57,952 --> 00:23:02,463
couching all sorts things are just cut him open to apso there might be some cards

304
00:23:02,527 --> 00:23:05,760
that look similar to each other isn't it is the same design but try different text

305
00:23:05,791 --> 00:23:06,560
or very subtle them

306
00:23:07,904 --> 00:23:12,479
but I think it will be nice because it be fairly small still quite tangible but

307
00:23:12,511 --> 00:23:13,823
with a very practical so that

308
00:23:16,352 --> 00:23:26,560
when it warrantee place Katz's also got some little case concepts which we say

309
00:23:27,712 --> 00:23:36,959
yes the clear there will be on the video after this one of the shed it

310
00:23:36,991 --> 00:23:44,031
feels a bit like we started setting up the new the new life will not Mr

311
00:23:44,095 --> 00:23:45,183
clean she should be

312
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:51,615
the quantum

313
00:23:54,687 --> 00:23:55,776
well we'll see how it goes

314
00:23:57,280 --> 00:23:59,135
please using and export
