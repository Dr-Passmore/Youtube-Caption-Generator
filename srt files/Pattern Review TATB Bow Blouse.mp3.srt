hello today I'm reviewing the bow blows bitterly and the buttons which came in simply sewing

1
00:00:13,152 --> 00:00:18,176
magazine it actually came over to Ishii's so you got the pattern pieces in the first

2
00:00:18,271 --> 00:00:24,319
issue along with the first part of the instructions and then the following issue had the

3
00:00:24,416 --> 00:00:30,016
second half of the instructions so for this make I made a size for and I

4
00:00:30,111 --> 00:00:35,456
didn't make any other adjustments to it the fabric I chose to use for this project

5
00:00:35,712 --> 00:00:42,880
is a lovely purple crepe from fabric land I'm assuming it sir polyester or polyester blend

6
00:00:43,136 --> 00:00:46,687
and but I did to get it couplers ago so I can't completely remember

7
00:00:47,967 --> 00:00:53,375
the pattern suggests to use this type of fabric or you know a great machine or

8
00:00:53,439 --> 00:00:58,944
something that drapes really well so this is actually quite a thick great fabric and but

9
00:00:59,007 --> 00:01:05,120
it still drapes nicely in terms of discorsi I found this person to be quite challenging

10
00:01:05,248 --> 00:01:12,736
personally firstly because of the fabric is quite slippery I did end up looking at the

11
00:01:12,832 --> 00:01:19,839
silly and the buttons website at how to manage slippery fabrics so I followed their guidance

12
00:01:19,935 --> 00:01:24,064
by spraying up with starch spray to make it a bit stiffer

13
00:01:25,375 --> 00:01:29,503
and I pinned it all before I cast this out just to make sure it didn't

14
00:01:29,599 --> 00:01:30,272
move the tool

15
00:01:31,519 --> 00:01:35,807
but I'm really glad I spent extra time on the cutting stage as I think it

16
00:01:36,160 --> 00:01:42,624
helped with the construction later on other difficulties with this pattern was the construction of the

17
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:48,704
collar and bow it is fairly simple but I never attached a collar to an item

18
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:54,143
before I'm really happy with it but I did get a bit confused I actually started

19
00:01:54,208 --> 00:01:59,552
this passen about fifteen months ago and then I got confused at the collar stage I'm

20
00:01:59,615 --> 00:02:02,304
not sure if it was just I couldn't

21
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:08,352
understand the instructions very well at the time but anyway I picked it back up again

22
00:02:08,735 --> 00:02:13,600
a couple of weeks ago and it just only seemed a lot clearer and I managed

23
00:02:13,632 --> 00:02:19,231
to get past that mental block so I don't know it's probably just me or you

24
00:02:19,296 --> 00:02:24,895
know sometimes when you read instructions and it doesn't make sense for ages or in a

25
00:02:25,024 --> 00:02:30,272
speech someone else and then it makes more sense I'm not really sure but I did

26
00:02:30,367 --> 00:02:37,279
find that aspect challenging just a bit attaching it to the oddest peace reget with regards

27
00:02:37,343 --> 00:02:42,880
to clarity most of the instructions were really clear as with all Tilly in the buttons

28
00:02:42,944 --> 00:02:48,000
passions it does for like someone holding your hand as you go through the process or

29
00:02:48,063 --> 00:02:52,992
they like I say I obviously just got to a mental block with adding the color

30
00:02:53,535 --> 00:02:59,423
I also struggled a bit with inserting the sleeves but I'm not sure if because I

31
00:02:59,647 --> 00:03:03,520
cut out the past and pieces about fifteen months ago and cut to the

32
00:03:04,576 --> 00:03:09,440
inserting sleeves last week I'm not sure if it's just that I didn't add all of

33
00:03:09,535 --> 00:03:15,007
the notches on to the past in pieces because I got quite confused and because though

34
00:03:15,455 --> 00:03:16,768
they put these lovely gathers

35
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:21,632
I'm at the top of the sleeves and I'm not sure if I just

36
00:03:22,688 --> 00:03:28,223
didn't have enough markings or something went a bit wrong with how I traced the markings

37
00:03:28,608 --> 00:03:33,472
from the pattern on to the fabric but anyway I got past that as well I'm

38
00:03:33,632 --> 00:03:38,399
and I think it looks fine now with the face it is designed as a loose-fitting

39
00:03:38,527 --> 00:03:44,416
blouse which again I've said before I quite like loose-fitting clothing so is perfect for my

40
00:03:44,544 --> 00:03:50,335
style I really like the design of this blows which is what drew me to making

41
00:03:50,623 --> 00:03:57,311
this particular about Blau's compared to other patterns I've seen or I've acquired in my stash

42
00:03:58,591 --> 00:04:03,744
I really like the bow detail at the front and the necklines really nice as well

43
00:04:03,807 --> 00:04:08,320
you get a lot of V-shaped necklines and patterns for by browsers but I really like

44
00:04:08,384 --> 00:04:11,455
this and gentle curves that you get with this one

45
00:04:13,087 --> 00:04:17,920
the pleats at the front there a couple on each and sighed at the front

46
00:04:19,264 --> 00:04:22,303
I mean there's also quite a nice box plate at the back as well

47
00:04:23,552 --> 00:04:26,399
I do like I'm this section at the top

48
00:04:27,488 --> 00:04:32,127
the bit of and gathering at the sleeves as well as also really nice and it's

49
00:04:32,287 --> 00:04:35,328
a half sleeves though it kind of cuts off by your elbow

50
00:04:36,544 --> 00:04:41,824
and again I'm not a big fan of long sleeves so this is pretty much as

51
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:46,048
low as my sleeves tend to go the hems a lovely detail as well so you

52
00:04:46,111 --> 00:04:48,959
can see and there's side splits as well

53
00:04:50,175 --> 00:04:57,088
and the front him is shorter than the back him it's very difficult to work out

54
00:04:57,152 --> 00:05:01,855
how much time I spent on this project because I did start it about fifteen months

55
00:05:01,951 --> 00:05:07,488
ago and finished it recently it did take me quite a long time so I would

56
00:05:07,584 --> 00:05:12,351
say it's is not a quick make is all I can really say on that overall

57
00:05:12,511 --> 00:05:16,768
I'm really happy with this make and I'm really surprised because I want to make another

58
00:05:16,832 --> 00:05:22,944
one even though it does take a lot of time and there are some bits where

59
00:05:23,007 --> 00:05:28,032
you need to be really accurate I'm actually really happy with the design at the end

60
00:05:28,256 --> 00:05:36,511
and the finish all of the seams of French scenes which I've never done before and

61
00:05:36,544 --> 00:05:41,055
but I think it's gonna make the garment lost a lot longer thanks for watching
