hello today I'm reviewing the simple t-shirt in the great British sewing be book so your

1
00:00:05,280 --> 00:00:08,736
own wardrobe as always if you like this video would like to see more please don't

2
00:00:08,767 --> 00:00:13,152
forget to like unsubscribe if you haven't already so to start off with the details of

3
00:00:13,279 --> 00:00:18,496
this pattern so it's called the simple tee shirt in this book and of I mentioned

4
00:00:18,591 --> 00:00:24,256
it's the same rowing wardrobe book so at this point I think less several great riches

5
00:00:24,319 --> 00:00:27,936
Tsering be books I've got a few of them but not all of them and I

6
00:00:28,159 --> 00:00:32,352
think this might be one of the earlier on one's may be the second or third

7
00:00:32,959 --> 00:00:33,728
not entirely show

8
00:00:34,816 --> 00:00:41,631
and so I made the spice fourteen and there aren't any variations on this pattern so

9
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:46,464
if you look at the book it doesn't give you any hacks or the ways to

10
00:00:46,527 --> 00:00:51,167
do it so I've just done it exactly as they said the fabric of used is

11
00:00:51,296 --> 00:00:56,799
a polyester crate so the main reason that I created this top is because it was

12
00:00:56,895 --> 00:01:02,271
left over fabric previously I've made a dress I feel like it's a so house so

13
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:07,263
in a pattern that anyway I've made a red dress in this fabric and I had

14
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:11,519
just enough to make this pattern so I thought I'd give it a go however I

15
00:01:11,648 --> 00:01:14,975
would not recommend you soon his fabric for this pattern so if you look at the

16
00:01:15,008 --> 00:01:22,975
book it suggests using a thin drapey fabric possibly a silk blend or anyway something like

17
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:23,648
create dasheen

18
00:01:24,767 --> 00:01:29,344
the problem with this is is quite a thick polyester crepe and although it drapes nicely

19
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:34,655
so it's not a complete disaster it is quite thick and I ran into a number

20
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:39,648
of issues because of that saying that being on to the difficulty of it it's quite

21
00:01:39,839 --> 00:01:40,736
a simple make

22
00:01:42,111 --> 00:01:46,367
but their hardest part of it is the fabric because you've got to choose a fabric

23
00:01:46,527 --> 00:01:47,583
which drapes well

24
00:01:48,767 --> 00:01:53,120
and of I mentioned I did choose the best one I still had the challenges

25
00:01:54,431 --> 00:01:58,527
of the ideal of fabric so and its it was quite slippery so you've got to

26
00:01:58,559 --> 00:02:00,000
be really careful when your casting out

27
00:02:01,216 --> 00:02:04,800
but in terms of the pieces you need to cut out you only have a front

28
00:02:04,863 --> 00:02:11,167
peace and the backpiece so it's not too much casting out you do need to make

29
00:02:11,199 --> 00:02:13,055
your unbiased finding so on the bottom

30
00:02:14,272 --> 00:02:20,095
for the him on the sleeves and on the neckline it's all bias finding and it

31
00:02:20,192 --> 00:02:23,968
shows you how to create that from your fabric so the books quite good in terms

32
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,184
of instructions but

33
00:02:26,304 --> 00:02:30,080
as I mentioned because it was quite a thick polyester crate it then meant it really

34
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:35,520
bulked up here and that's why if you look if you see this top closer you

35
00:02:35,583 --> 00:02:39,776
can see that there's a bit of a rippled effect where I've really had to wrestle

36
00:02:39,807 --> 00:02:46,367
with the fabric to get it to lay flattish but yes so it's not perfect so

37
00:02:46,591 --> 00:02:50,720
it's quite simple in some ways because there aren't many seems to sew up so what

38
00:02:50,783 --> 00:02:56,992
the to shoulder seams and you've got the side seams and its effectively grow on sleeves

39
00:02:57,727 --> 00:03:02,111
however there are quite a lot of curves to contend with again you've got that slippery

40
00:03:02,175 --> 00:03:06,880
fabric and then you've got to attach a whole lot of bias finding on curves so

41
00:03:07,104 --> 00:03:12,287
it's got high-low him so there's quite a bit you need to work with so it's

42
00:03:13,695 --> 00:03:18,335
it's a bit of a deceptive pattern in terms of difficulty in terms of clarity I

43
00:03:18,559 --> 00:03:24,800
found the instructions pretty clear it has a separate section to give you a master class

44
00:03:25,024 --> 00:03:28,447
on working with bias finding how to create your own

45
00:03:29,664 --> 00:03:34,496
how you can finish off both the visible and concealed method so

46
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:40,000
it does show you all of that it doesn't go into a huge amount of detail

47
00:03:40,095 --> 00:03:44,768
on how you can finish it off nicely at the start an end which I guess

48
00:03:45,343 --> 00:03:49,408
may have helped obviously there are lots of useful tutorials online as well which you can

49
00:03:49,503 --> 00:03:53,983
look at to help you out and but yet that's my main criticism I guess is

50
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:58,688
that they could have possibly added a bit more detail on their but apart from that

51
00:03:58,751 --> 00:04:02,559
as I mentioned there's not a huge amount of construction minus the vice finding say

52
00:04:03,839 --> 00:04:09,376
there weren't too many instructions but the illustrations looked pretty clear in terms of design and

53
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:12,800
fit if I put aside the fact that I choose the wrong of fabric for this

54
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:18,687
particular project I really like the design of this talk so I quite like the neckline

55
00:04:18,847 --> 00:04:20,032
it fits quite comfortably

56
00:04:21,119 --> 00:04:25,888
I'm a fan of grown sleeves and it's obviously a lot easier to make as I

57
00:04:25,951 --> 00:04:29,567
didn't need to stick to on the set for of sleeps well there will be see

58
00:04:29,696 --> 00:04:34,399
video of separate sleeves sometimes you can fit it slightly better to yourself and I think

59
00:04:34,496 --> 00:04:39,200
if you have the right fabric it would look at bulky at the sides it would

60
00:04:39,488 --> 00:04:40,320
drink lord better

61
00:04:41,727 --> 00:04:45,760
I really like the high low hum and it's quite nicely curved

62
00:04:46,783 --> 00:04:51,776
and it's quite a good one that I can use both the home the casual wear

63
00:04:51,903 --> 00:04:56,447
so I can wear it with jeggings like a dinner but I could also where it

64
00:04:56,704 --> 00:05:00,127
if I need to take it to work or I could if I needed to look

65
00:05:00,223 --> 00:05:05,824
smart somewhere I can just dress it up or down appropriately the time taken I think

66
00:05:06,432 --> 00:05:09,279
for a confidence I missed you could easily do this in a day

67
00:05:10,687 --> 00:05:17,567
because I went horrendously wrong I had to unpick the bias finding and then reattach it

68
00:05:17,727 --> 00:05:21,183
as best as I could so it didn't take me a couple of days to then

69
00:05:21,312 --> 00:05:22,175
break to buy it

70
00:05:23,488 --> 00:05:27,488
but it definitely is one that if you're quite confident and happy with by his finding

71
00:05:27,808 --> 00:05:32,223
you could just get on with it and make it easily in the day so to

72
00:05:32,415 --> 00:05:37,984
complete and I really like the design of this top I'd quite like to make it

73
00:05:38,111 --> 00:05:43,615
again in another fabric a thin fabric one that still drapes nicely but

74
00:05:44,704 --> 00:05:47,712
won't come across the same issues that I did previously

75
00:05:48,832 --> 00:05:52,511
even with this talk to be honest I think maybe if I just bought some thin

76
00:05:52,671 --> 00:05:57,503
silk bias finding rather than creating some from the actual fabric it might have settled a

77
00:05:57,567 --> 00:06:01,183
bit better and but it's just one of those things and to be honest I made

78
00:06:01,216 --> 00:06:04,992
this a while ago and I have worn it tuns even though it has a really

79
00:06:05,279 --> 00:06:10,559
properly neckline so it hasn't put me off which makes me think that it probably is

80
00:06:10,656 --> 00:06:15,903
worth making another one and that one will hopefully be even better so that set for

81
00:06:15,967 --> 00:06:17,247
this time thanks for watching
