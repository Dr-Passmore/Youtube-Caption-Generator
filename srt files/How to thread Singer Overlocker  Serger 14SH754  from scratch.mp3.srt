00:00:00,128 --> 00:00:04,895
hello today I'm going to show you how I rethread my overlocker from scratch other way

1
00:00:04,992 --> 00:00:07,840
that you like this video I'd like to see more please don't forget to like unsubscribe

2
00:00:07,903 --> 00:00:12,064
if you haven't already as I mentioned before I have the singer fourteen FH seven five

3
00:00:12,128 --> 00:00:15,935
for model which is a budget range of a locker the easiest way to refresh your

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:21,087
overlook it is to do the tion method where you tie the old threads to your

5
00:00:21,184 --> 00:00:26,464
new colored thread and pull it through with attention this to zero however I'm now going

6
00:00:26,559 --> 00:00:30,304
to show you how to read read it from scratch it's really important to know how

7
00:00:30,399 --> 00:00:34,784
to do this because it can result a lot of issues for you if there are

8
00:00:34,847 --> 00:00:39,391
some reason it's just not playing for with you a key way to result that is

9
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:44,799
to rethread the machine it could be that is either gone wrong somewhere so there's a

10
00:00:44,895 --> 00:00:48,895
bit where it should be hooked on that it isn't him or it could be another

11
00:00:48,959 --> 00:00:55,360
reason where rethreading would just resolve the matter for you it's definitely one of the things

12
00:00:55,423 --> 00:00:59,776
to consider if you just can't get attention right is to just right rethreading it it

13
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:03,040
might actually resolve the problem for you the doxie times you have to do it as

14
00:01:03,071 --> 00:01:08,832
well for example if a thread snaps and which again prophecy could be attention issue but

15
00:01:09,472 --> 00:01:12,896
you do have to to thread your machine in a particular order so if you don't

16
00:01:13,024 --> 00:01:17,791
rethread the one that's broken it could actually mess up the whole system and then it

17
00:01:17,888 --> 00:01:22,816
won't overlock as it's designed to so it's always best to if it's

18
00:01:23,839 --> 00:01:28,704
the first regiment to thread you've got to redo all of them theoretically okay so on

19
00:01:28,767 --> 00:01:32,223
my next project I want to use this black threat so I'm going to take you

20
00:01:32,319 --> 00:01:36,671
how to thread its first thing to do is to open up the

21
00:01:38,879 --> 00:01:40,192
and then I can see all the different

22
00:01:41,216 --> 00:01:44,671
areas that I will need to thread the machine so on mine I've got this very

23
00:01:44,736 --> 00:01:49,599
useful gauge which is very handy and so it tells me that I need to thread

24
00:01:49,856 --> 00:01:54,688
the red and colocated one first which is this one here and then I need to

25
00:01:54,751 --> 00:01:59,776
move over to the next Luke reference and finally I do the needles at the top

26
00:02:00,255 --> 00:02:04,671
but even the needles are actually labeled three and four so I'm just going to follow

27
00:02:04,896 --> 00:02:09,632
the exact order to be safe something you do need to remember and before you start

28
00:02:09,695 --> 00:02:14,656
completely because you are returning it from scratch you don't have to actually set your attention

29
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:17,535
this to zero you can if you want to but you do need to remember to

30
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:21,695
put it back up to the correct tension so you can just leave it for example

31
00:02:22,335 --> 00:02:25,440
and I'm going to put mine to three next because I need to work out the

32
00:02:25,503 --> 00:02:26,912
correct tension for my new project

33
00:02:28,128 --> 00:02:31,647
so I'm gonna put it out there for now just because I'm nice again another thing

34
00:02:31,712 --> 00:02:34,720
you need to do is make sure the press of it is up because this will

35
00:02:34,815 --> 00:02:37,600
disengage those tension size so just check

36
00:02:45,695 --> 00:02:52,992
okay so my precedents already up the last line and Kate so first things first I'm

37
00:02:53,024 --> 00:02:56,128
going to just quickly Loti's onto the school's at the back

38
00:02:59,264 --> 00:03:02,656
as I mentioned the first one that I need to threat is this one so I'm

39
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:06,464
just going to loosely put it into the guide at the top

40
00:03:08,416 --> 00:03:09,856
and then going to attach it

41
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:14,623
there's a little hook at the top that it needs to leap around

42
00:03:19,679 --> 00:03:24,128
so I've just added it there you need to make sure it goes straight through the

43
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:28,895
attention to scare nice and cleanly so it's always good to essentially help up and talk

44
00:03:28,927 --> 00:03:34,432
about the thread thought just make sure it's sandwich likely into the tension lisk the the

45
00:03:34,527 --> 00:03:38,527
hook lower down one this machine so you need to make sure that that's that you're

46
00:03:38,559 --> 00:03:39,520
thread it is hooked in there

47
00:03:40,639 --> 00:03:42,944
and then you continue down there still so

48
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,712
as I mentioned before you can see exactly where you need to Fred on this machine

49
00:03:47,968 --> 00:03:53,119
there's also colocated dots so I'm just going to cook it on to all those bits

50
00:03:55,104 --> 00:03:59,296
the final destination for this set of red is to go through

51
00:04:01,279 --> 00:04:05,600
lupa so that's the needle it comes across on your fabric that I'm going to give

52
00:04:05,664 --> 00:04:06,335
my tweezers here

53
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:19,135
I put the bread at the front corner just because I've been talked previously to put

54
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:23,295
the lever threats towards the front to start with and then the needle threats towards the

55
00:04:23,328 --> 00:04:27,424
back and option what about the house but apparently back and

56
00:04:28,992 --> 00:04:33,407
get rid of potential issues as well so the next one only to thread is the

57
00:04:33,567 --> 00:04:38,559
other leap at witches to my machine the yellow color-code so again and will put it

58
00:04:38,783 --> 00:04:39,391
around the glide

59
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:41,664
touch of the top here

60
00:04:43,808 --> 00:04:46,720
make sure it's sandwich nicely in the attention

61
00:04:48,384 --> 00:04:49,376
and as the attached

62
00:04:50,847 --> 00:04:51,615
make sure it's leaped

63
00:04:53,791 --> 00:04:54,335
underneath is

64
00:04:56,480 --> 00:05:01,664
now this is possibly the worst thread that you have to threaten so you start off

65
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:02,111
nicely

66
00:05:06,944 --> 00:05:10,303
so again you got a nice collar code system that's all simple just make sure it's

67
00:05:10,335 --> 00:05:14,368
snapped into those sections then it starts to get over a tricky

68
00:05:15,872 --> 00:05:17,600
so that one is not too bad

69
00:05:20,223 --> 00:05:21,440
then as you can see on

70
00:05:22,592 --> 00:05:26,911
on the diagram here then has to leap up behind

71
00:05:28,287 --> 00:05:32,928
a section of the machine so the needle that is eventually going to loop through you

72
00:05:33,023 --> 00:05:34,752
have to draw up behind that

73
00:05:36,511 --> 00:05:38,847
and then it hooks on a bit at the corner

74
00:05:40,384 --> 00:05:43,552
and then you threat it through the eye of the legal so this is definitely the

75
00:05:43,615 --> 00:05:48,608
worst part and on other models you can undo this section of the machine and you

76
00:05:48,704 --> 00:05:52,832
can see the other side then although it can get thus to that model of machine

77
00:05:52,992 --> 00:05:57,631
it's too much easier to read at this point so yeah this is definitely that I

78
00:05:57,727 --> 00:06:00,832
got frustrated but so is gonna do my best

79
00:06:07,615 --> 00:06:10,783
they have just managed to get it around the back of that needle and I'm just

80
00:06:10,816 --> 00:06:11,135
going to

81
00:06:12,287 --> 00:06:14,687
hold on to this section and not it with

82
00:06:16,671 --> 00:06:17,503
with my tweezers

83
00:06:18,687 --> 00:06:21,567
until it attaches to that little hook at the end

84
00:06:29,567 --> 00:06:33,855
okay by fluking house sauces in place just then I would move it around a little

85
00:06:33,888 --> 00:06:37,791
bit with the dial if it's not quite in the right position it is then and

86
00:06:37,824 --> 00:06:41,152
there that was easier for catching it on the corner I know need to move it

87
00:06:41,216 --> 00:06:43,391
to be able to Trent the eye of the needle

88
00:06:44,799 --> 00:06:47,328
again I'm going to use the pleases that came with the machine

89
00:06:51,712 --> 00:06:52,608
and threat that through

90
00:06:56,063 --> 00:07:00,063
case once more I've got the loop of thread at the front okay so the next

91
00:07:00,127 --> 00:07:06,048
thread to threaten is number three which is green on my machine which is less tension

92
00:07:06,144 --> 00:07:06,399
dial

93
00:07:09,279 --> 00:07:10,335
to find the end of this one

94
00:07:12,191 --> 00:07:15,648
hip on the guide once more and touch it the back

95
00:07:16,832 --> 00:07:20,895
make sure it goes through the tension desk so on the green thread

96
00:07:22,528 --> 00:07:23,040
you need to

97
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:27,519
has guided on the diagram

98
00:07:29,055 --> 00:07:32,063
there are two books that goes through and then it goes up on this topless again

99
00:07:32,127 --> 00:07:33,951
is colocated on this machine which helps

100
00:07:35,455 --> 00:07:38,208
and you need to throw it on to needle

101
00:07:40,544 --> 00:07:46,175
an excellent rounds and the five and then again these teasers are really useful for threading

102
00:07:46,496 --> 00:07:46,880
the needle

103
00:07:48,384 --> 00:07:49,343
so with the

104
00:07:51,776 --> 00:07:56,928
needle threats I going to pull them towards the back corner finally I'm going to read

105
00:07:57,088 --> 00:07:59,648
the final needles rent again up over the guide

106
00:08:02,592 --> 00:08:04,575
across that bit at the top

107
00:08:06,015 --> 00:08:10,272
talks through their now on the blue thread that you do need to move that again

108
00:08:10,432 --> 00:08:15,231
on the same one at the second hook that the green threat is also one but

109
00:08:15,519 --> 00:08:17,951
it goes through its own guide in this section

110
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:22,175
and you loop that true for needle be

111
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:25,152
and once more

112
00:08:27,007 --> 00:08:27,391
the needle

113
00:08:30,303 --> 00:08:33,728
know that the machine is fully threaded I'm going to put the process it down

114
00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:38,111
through all this right together towards the back

115
00:08:39,455 --> 00:08:42,656
I can close that I see if you did leave the tension this is zero you

116
00:08:42,719 --> 00:08:46,976
can now ruddles the tension and although I haven't got any public air on just going

117
00:08:47,039 --> 00:08:49,984
to test that the machine is running smoothly so

118
00:08:51,104 --> 00:08:51,520
switched on

119
00:08:58,815 --> 00:09:02,752
so that looks like it's all threaded up fine it's coming out in this sort of

120
00:09:02,943 --> 00:09:03,328
strange

121
00:09:04,479 --> 00:09:08,799
for thread chain which is normal for this machine so the next step I do is

122
00:09:08,864 --> 00:09:12,479
to get a track piece of the fabric I want to use and how to go

123
00:09:12,575 --> 00:09:17,504
ahead and start adjusting and fine-tuning the tension so that it's perfect for that project Hey

124
00:09:17,599 --> 00:09:19,520
that's it for this time thanks for watching
