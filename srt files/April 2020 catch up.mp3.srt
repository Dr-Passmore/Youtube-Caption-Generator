hello and welcome back today is the best of a capture as always if you like

1
00:00:03,871 --> 00:00:06,688
this video I want to see more please I forget to like unsubscribe if you aren't

2
00:00:06,751 --> 00:00:10,368
already right so it's been a few weeks since we did a catch up last time

3
00:00:10,623 --> 00:00:15,935
I broke fell back in know my fellow lockdown body there I just thought I do

4
00:00:16,288 --> 00:00:22,271
a favor catch up on what I've been up to so I mentioned in my twenty

5
00:00:22,431 --> 00:00:27,583
twenty pounds that there were a couple of big birthdays this year so ones already passed

6
00:00:27,743 --> 00:00:31,775
as I mentioned in this I think I ever catch up and I made a dressing

7
00:00:31,871 --> 00:00:34,847
gown for that and that was one of my make line which was checked with the

8
00:00:34,911 --> 00:00:41,631
listened for this one I decided to make a shore so I am recording little their

9
00:00:41,728 --> 00:00:45,055
early just because I need to post it and totally awesome

10
00:00:47,071 --> 00:00:51,296
I've got it in here so and this is a drawstring bag that I have also

11
00:00:51,551 --> 00:00:56,639
recently made and I will post a tutorial on it shortly possibly next week so it's

12
00:00:56,703 --> 00:01:01,664
a nice simple was in mind drawstring bag I have actually used fabric which I got

13
00:01:01,855 --> 00:01:06,559
one year or so Saturday event and that was local at the sewing studio in rubbery

14
00:01:09,888 --> 00:01:14,496
Yep so I've done it designed so it fits the so nicely of an extra little

15
00:01:14,527 --> 00:01:15,776
gift in now which is the brooch man

16
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:24,096
yeah I don't want to open up because it was packaged so nicely yet so hopefully

17
00:01:24,160 --> 00:01:25,407
its find in that but I'm sure

18
00:01:26,624 --> 00:01:30,239
so this is the shore so this is done with broomstick crochet

19
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:33,888
which is when to use a joint knitting needle that's about

20
00:01:35,103 --> 00:01:38,015
to an often to meet us in diameter or twenty-five or

21
00:01:39,167 --> 00:01:40,000
I guess that's an inch is

22
00:01:41,279 --> 00:01:44,575
yes it's a really big listen you will be only use one and then you use

23
00:01:44,639 --> 00:01:49,952
a creature her the inside and you basically draw up the stitches on to the sentinel

24
00:01:50,527 --> 00:01:54,304
and then you croche double pressure the most in group of four

25
00:01:56,064 --> 00:02:02,688
and so yeah but this one first up neatly agents and but I really just go

26
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:07,487
around to making it I think I always did plan to make it to this particular

27
00:02:07,552 --> 00:02:09,343
to the first day not be so

28
00:02:11,039 --> 00:02:15,104
yes just been just been waiting in the in the sash like not the other thing

29
00:02:16,192 --> 00:02:21,632
so that's another of my neck minus to check up on the added again I sat

30
00:02:21,664 --> 00:02:26,143
salad it was going to go with little carry one with the birthday seems so

31
00:02:27,328 --> 00:02:30,111
even though they're just going to be in the house of the rain

32
00:02:32,544 --> 00:02:36,320
and not having a party into obviously it's safe to do so and but I still

33
00:02:36,416 --> 00:02:40,287
thought you know what I mean a badge for the other special birthday gonna make a

34
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:44,735
badge again or a rose at so I've gone for a slightly different design I did

35
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:48,927
a much simple one last time and but this one's a bit more freely and a

36
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:50,175
bit more like a river so

37
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:55,712
I've just used some scrubs in my stash and they actually much a set of pajama

38
00:02:55,744 --> 00:02:58,815
bottoms I made them as well so you need to hear to chill out in those

39
00:02:58,880 --> 00:03:04,544
pajamas and have a matching yeah but they resent it was I still had a bit

40
00:03:04,608 --> 00:03:08,832
of that fabric left I don't have a lot of honor but I also made one

41
00:03:08,895 --> 00:03:14,623
of those simple face was patterns that are online and I've made two different sizes because

42
00:03:14,751 --> 00:03:16,447
I can't tell which one was that better

43
00:03:17,535 --> 00:03:20,447
so I'm just gonna post both of them to and I don't know she

44
00:03:21,567 --> 00:03:23,936
may be the smaller one on the teddy bear of a dozen sense

45
00:03:25,951 --> 00:03:31,136
something like that as though she's got out matching facemask to go with her or that

46
00:03:31,488 --> 00:03:33,600
the forest for she has the last so

47
00:03:35,072 --> 00:03:38,720
she's probably sick of face months by this point and because she has to wear them

48
00:03:38,783 --> 00:03:43,712
at work but I just thought this might be a bit more of her and what

49
00:03:43,744 --> 00:03:48,479
is the domestic one so obviously and she can't bring the face mushies of that work

50
00:03:48,703 --> 00:03:51,583
home because they need to be used at work so

51
00:03:52,863 --> 00:03:56,800
it will make this argosy isn't as effective as the as a proper the button yeah

52
00:03:56,895 --> 00:04:01,408
exactly so I'm cheek my life she wishes and she can match the but they wrote

53
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:03,072
that so it's really

54
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:11,328
you really like this fabric so it's a bit sad that I don't you got tiny

55
00:04:11,391 --> 00:04:15,104
little cross to the left but it's good to use it I think I got it

56
00:04:15,167 --> 00:04:19,903
from a charity shop to be honest and but yeah I've got my he said finally

57
00:04:19,967 --> 00:04:25,951
on the best different I've made a card as well so and I mentioned before the

58
00:04:26,048 --> 00:04:29,152
channel one day in the hundred-day projects where I'm doing a hundred days of free machine

59
00:04:29,247 --> 00:04:36,351
embroiders animals so I'm a bit tired of through machining outside of that so I decided

60
00:04:36,415 --> 00:04:39,391
to hands to this one for a change so it took a little at a time

61
00:04:39,455 --> 00:04:45,312
but it was quite fun to divert of hand the broidery instead so just done backstitch

62
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:50,623
for the the text and Ivy's change search for the rainbow

63
00:04:51,648 --> 00:04:56,415
this was actually you're right there wasn't a what he wanted have you dismissed it immediately

64
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:59,967
will not suggested it does make me think of the and

65
00:05:01,152 --> 00:05:04,704
well yeah well to be fair she's you know she worked the hostile

66
00:05:07,135 --> 00:05:12,191
she's faced with it quite a lot already and will be for a consider one time

67
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:14,111
you know it's a vector to work but

68
00:05:15,359 --> 00:05:17,984
in the end I could think of anything else and then I thought well

69
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:22,528
you can't avoid what's happening and right by the matter colorful

70
00:05:23,712 --> 00:05:28,768
the rainbow is being used as a support the NHS simple wooden the UK

71
00:05:30,272 --> 00:05:30,432
don't

72
00:05:33,152 --> 00:05:34,368
it's got a bit more by red

73
00:05:40,415 --> 00:05:46,272
wine I said Billy asyla to go out for one day the houses of exercise so

74
00:05:46,623 --> 00:05:48,895
it's why nice to see how many rainbows even spot

75
00:05:51,712 --> 00:05:56,511
with the hundred-day project as its sons to say so over some recording this infant slightly

76
00:05:56,895 --> 00:05:59,295
I've done just be the town centre the project

77
00:06:00,928 --> 00:06:06,528
yes it's been interesting I have got to you sick about you know I think to

78
00:06:06,559 --> 00:06:10,303
be really good I really please one should complete it I think the main challenge for

79
00:06:10,368 --> 00:06:15,808
me is actually sketching out the design every day it's not very confident drawing a and

80
00:06:15,839 --> 00:06:19,007
take a lot googling of how to draw this animal and then

81
00:06:20,032 --> 00:06:24,063
also its finding the right friends I'm going to use up a lot of my less

82
00:06:25,247 --> 00:06:27,391
Lester good quality threating this project

83
00:06:28,735 --> 00:06:30,720
is quite a good ones that to the person

84
00:06:33,984 --> 00:06:37,791
I might also need to more bleach halakhah before them because I'm not sure I'm gonna

85
00:06:37,824 --> 00:06:38,880
get sent out

86
00:06:43,424 --> 00:06:44,160
what's that

87
00:06:53,567 --> 00:06:55,391
quiet I think my favorite is the any

88
00:06:57,376 --> 00:07:02,175
yeah and I quite like the same rise and it will say because I had to

89
00:07:02,208 --> 00:07:03,615
go all the same right while

90
00:07:05,119 --> 00:07:06,752
I love have to document an informant

91
00:07:08,447 --> 00:07:13,503
you'll do the time lapse in between which

92
00:07:15,967 --> 00:07:19,167
is based it so many photos an Instagram consistently said

93
00:07:20,608 --> 00:07:21,631
only place they may say

94
00:07:23,007 --> 00:07:26,335
well that was quite late last night was nice but it was the end of the

95
00:07:26,399 --> 00:07:27,135
working week and

96
00:07:28,191 --> 00:07:30,463
I really time or the handsome the design yet

97
00:07:32,928 --> 00:07:35,903
and then over seal be hard to make this stuff for the birthdays along the same

98
00:07:36,799 --> 00:07:41,791
a meeting I walked in the white an internal used to get not Gianelli I can't

99
00:07:41,888 --> 00:07:45,727
find from trans machine varied up an animal before you start like

100
00:07:47,552 --> 00:07:49,279
I had so we don't have deck me at the moment

101
00:07:51,872 --> 00:07:58,720
got that time available so dress-making was unbearable makes from the make it simple book

102
00:08:00,191 --> 00:08:00,511
is

103
00:08:01,696 --> 00:08:02,976
now I've recorded by to them

104
00:08:04,256 --> 00:08:05,567
so it was the juniper dollars

105
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:08,928
which is more like a one and a half

106
00:08:10,496 --> 00:08:10,816
because

107
00:08:12,127 --> 00:08:15,455
it's like this you know for John the bottom but you have them to short

108
00:08:16,511 --> 00:08:20,864
but there are really clear instructions to do and then the top of these shorty pajamas

109
00:08:21,343 --> 00:08:22,272
is the top of Atisha

110
00:08:23,936 --> 00:08:26,720
so I kind of felt like one and a half persons from the back

111
00:08:28,127 --> 00:08:34,591
forty and and the other one I make more recently was the Safiya Danbury's but I

112
00:08:34,687 --> 00:08:38,976
made a short version and I also kept the elasticated waste man from this the VK

113
00:08:39,104 --> 00:08:39,392
suits

114
00:08:40,575 --> 00:08:44,223
yes I'm already faced in a review on that which you can see I think next

115
00:08:44,383 --> 00:08:47,711
I am going to move on to the tsuki dress

116
00:08:48,736 --> 00:08:53,440
because it looks really nice and simple the main problem that I've had and the main

117
00:08:53,504 --> 00:08:58,208
reason I have made it yet is because I need a fabric that's wide enough and

118
00:08:58,719 --> 00:09:03,359
that there's enough of it because it's actually it's only me I'm going to make the

119
00:09:03,392 --> 00:09:06,015
version that short-sleeved so I don't need to

120
00:09:07,168 --> 00:09:08,703
cut out the long

121
00:09:09,856 --> 00:09:14,335
I don't need to cut out the sleeve person yeah pieces however it does mean that

122
00:09:14,367 --> 00:09:19,200
because it's got a slight grown on sleeve it's quite a wide happen

123
00:09:20,288 --> 00:09:24,383
so if you got a narrow that fabric you can't fit

124
00:09:25,599 --> 00:09:29,408
let's both the front and back next to each other you have to use more of

125
00:09:29,471 --> 00:09:29,791
the length

126
00:09:31,007 --> 00:09:34,400
so I'm just trying to find something at home I don't really want to buy any

127
00:09:34,463 --> 00:09:38,752
fabric for this and also it's obviously taking a world to get deliveries at the moment

128
00:09:38,848 --> 00:09:43,263
so yeah I want to see I'm might actually that green fabric

129
00:09:49,056 --> 00:09:52,447
yeah so I think that might be quite nice I was going to use this like

130
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:58,143
agi picked it up fabric but I'm not sure it will look that right it's kind

131
00:09:58,208 --> 00:10:03,296
of it's a very lightweight cotton it's probably almost a quilting Costas and not sure I

132
00:10:03,392 --> 00:10:05,504
think it's gonna sharp creases really really

133
00:10:07,039 --> 00:10:10,687
I think I'm not really sure I'm gonna do with that fabric possibly I might make

134
00:10:10,752 --> 00:10:15,200
you a shower with it I think I would probably look nicer Lona's leashing draft but

135
00:10:17,056 --> 00:10:20,416
I'm obviously got some nice fabric for a first shot when I find it round up

136
00:10:22,783 --> 00:10:25,312
and apart from that the other thing I've planned to make

137
00:10:26,335 --> 00:10:31,935
is a gift for another family member it is another birthday coming up in me and

138
00:10:32,192 --> 00:10:32,351
it's

139
00:10:33,632 --> 00:10:38,463
it's not a milestone birthday to say but I do want to make something especially it

140
00:10:38,495 --> 00:10:42,976
or not really sure what else I buy for them at that moment I'm sure that

141
00:10:43,007 --> 00:10:47,168
something again I can purchase online stone and get it sent to the house but

142
00:10:48,351 --> 00:10:51,520
yeah I have to have a think about that that's probably the next thing going to

143
00:10:52,127 --> 00:10:56,671
do but I think it's going to it's going to be a knit make and McKinney's

144
00:10:56,768 --> 00:11:00,927
net fabric I don't think she watches this channel but just in case she got the

145
00:11:01,023 --> 00:11:06,335
and say but I do need to fix my overlocker for the an essentially I really

146
00:11:06,495 --> 00:11:12,127
damaged one of my overlocker needles when I was make when I was just finishing off

147
00:11:12,416 --> 00:11:18,367
the top of the data for my pajamas and yeah it just completely and it's that

148
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:23,231
promised an instant yeah I think about

149
00:11:25,728 --> 00:11:31,935
partially can use it with I'm only one needle see what three red looking so that

150
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:37,664
was fine when I was making this to be a lacy Embury hackbuts food next I'd

151
00:11:37,695 --> 00:11:40,064
rather have faced needles and the Boche

152
00:11:41,504 --> 00:11:46,976
yeah yeah so they've turned up now not and but we also thought that perhaps the

153
00:11:47,231 --> 00:11:49,599
blades he had changing because I've never changed them

154
00:11:50,687 --> 00:11:55,392
was also here for a kind of bad news about corn the fabric and pretend she

155
00:11:55,455 --> 00:11:58,848
not counting off fast enough for us who it belonged yeah

156
00:12:00,096 --> 00:12:04,255
to replace one place Harry that we see if that helps you know the interest and

157
00:12:04,288 --> 00:12:08,064
see that makes a difference because I don't know how often use face to change the

158
00:12:08,096 --> 00:12:08,351
blade

159
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:14,367
I mean is still casting and but I don't know whether you space to choose to

160
00:12:14,752 --> 00:12:19,616
for frequently I've had it quite a number of years and I really like her mother

161
00:12:19,679 --> 00:12:26,783
how long but you know it's not like it's just being a compass really was the

162
00:12:26,848 --> 00:12:27,007
place

163
00:12:31,520 --> 00:12:32,544
to sit it was a machine

164
00:12:33,567 --> 00:12:34,208
that silly

165
00:12:35,583 --> 00:12:39,328
and I guess you don't have to change them frequently they'll be interested to see how

166
00:12:39,583 --> 00:12:42,080
often you should change them more interesting

167
00:12:47,487 --> 00:12:53,375
when I just go and every a needle know that yet open so that that might

168
00:12:53,408 --> 00:12:56,768
be wise and blunt or but before

169
00:12:58,367 --> 00:13:05,440

170
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:09,567

172
00:13:15,935 --> 00:13:18,815

173
00:13:19,935 --> 00:13:24,960
