00:00:00,159 --> 00:00:05,472
welcome to take our minds off the awful pandemic and locked down you part of a

1
00:00:05,535 --> 00:00:08,447
crafty day for us to do say what to be fair you came up with that

2
00:00:08,543 --> 00:00:12,543
crafty day so today we're going to make ourselves from the face was so I was

3
00:00:12,576 --> 00:00:16,959
going to make them anyway and any suggested that we both make them so that's what

4
00:00:16,992 --> 00:00:19,648
we're going to do today as always if you let this video and would like to

5
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:22,944
see more please I forget to like a full squad with you haven't already so it's

6
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:27,743
not a tutorial were going to follow another free tutorial were going to be using the

7
00:00:27,808 --> 00:00:33,119
Italy and the buttons face mask there is so many out there I just couldn't decide

8
00:00:33,472 --> 00:00:36,703
the ages which must to do which is why it's kind of thinking two months to

9
00:00:37,408 --> 00:00:41,439
make us face once I mentioned in a recent catchup I did make one from my

10
00:00:41,504 --> 00:00:45,568
mom I'm just because I had some not to the fabric and from making her back

11
00:00:45,664 --> 00:00:50,048
to match that I thought Hey well don't make a matching fixed mask for that thing

12
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:54,944
anyway I wasn't that keen on the shape of that face Marceau I thought would try

13
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:59,487
a different one specifically one with Clete's know we're going to do there to the buttons

14
00:00:59,551 --> 00:01:03,040
one but I do you have some elastic so I think we're going to substitute the

15
00:01:03,104 --> 00:01:04,031
times for elastic

16
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:07,807
just because it be easier to put on a not so the first thing we need

17
00:01:07,872 --> 00:01:12,575
to do at Shiva is use the iron so for an island bought a little other

18
00:01:12,671 --> 00:01:12,767
one

19
00:01:13,952 --> 00:01:14,559
just listen

20
00:01:20,096 --> 00:01:20,928
I've got a same data

21
00:01:22,047 --> 00:01:25,536
which will help so do I make to go bust to you then

22
00:01:26,688 --> 00:01:27,711
I will watch you on

23
00:01:28,896 --> 00:01:31,360
so the first thing we need to do is

24
00:01:35,807 --> 00:01:36,031
really

25
00:01:46,111 --> 00:01:46,720
important

26
00:01:47,839 --> 00:01:51,424
it's a trial anyway to see if it's a good one so the first thing she

27
00:01:51,487 --> 00:01:53,503
seeks to do is twofold a centimeter

28
00:01:54,624 --> 00:01:58,400
in on each side and then a father once and tweeters never got there seeing gauge

29
00:01:58,463 --> 00:02:00,351
which makes it a lot easier

30
00:02:01,919 --> 00:02:02,431
for me anyway

31
00:02:04,671 --> 00:02:09,759
because it's a nice stable caught in it being a price and it's a minister like

32
00:02:10,751 --> 00:02:14,720
say I'm just gonna fight over that lets them twice wollen down this and

33
00:02:18,207 --> 00:02:20,447
that's it you can see just how the

34
00:02:24,384 --> 00:02:25,695
case that's one side done and then

35
00:02:27,583 --> 00:02:49,759
going to do the other side that was the last time he used to serving dishes

36
00:02:49,824 --> 00:02:50,559
my sewing machine

37
00:03:08,735 --> 00:03:09,376
and

38
00:03:10,848 --> 00:03:14,944
so you have the wrong side facing it men and your funding one sent me sit

39
00:03:14,975 --> 00:03:15,199
down

40
00:03:24,255 --> 00:03:31,423
I mean you've actually got gridlike fabric but press actually where the what it is instead

41
00:03:31,455 --> 00:03:36,128
the top of the white square and I just so maybe repress the spences right on

42
00:03:36,192 --> 00:03:37,951
the white square and then carrier

43
00:03:55,871 --> 00:04:01,024
next were stitching down and please forwarded edges in place they were just stitching place to

44
00:04:01,087 --> 00:04:01,184
the

45
00:04:02,559 --> 00:04:13,535
inner folded at your base slide across a pro

46
00:04:15,744 --> 00:04:19,071
so really just seen textless no more qualified than me

47
00:04:22,656 --> 00:04:23,135
but the first

48
00:04:45,984 --> 00:04:48,223
right the next thing we're doing is where

49
00:04:52,287 --> 00:04:54,048
we weren't ready

50
00:04:56,287 --> 00:04:58,976
right see need to bring my still working with rightsize to

51
00:05:01,696 --> 00:05:04,191
so you need to fold it in half so that your to

52
00:05:05,376 --> 00:05:06,911
hmms edges are at the top

53
00:05:13,567 --> 00:05:17,536
there for the awesome I guess and need them matching yet that it's going up about

54
00:05:21,247 --> 00:05:21,920
it so the meat

55
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:34,911
and then you gonna do

56
00:05:39,167 --> 00:06:02,720
you need to find five centuries in person so it's five sentry to them and so

57
00:06:02,816 --> 00:06:08,640
I'm going forward of that and that I'm using the lever's go back to implementing diddies

58
00:06:08,735 --> 00:06:09,183
at the school

59
00:06:22,911 --> 00:06:29,312
again all right

60
00:06:45,183 --> 00:06:49,664
okay so the next thing is to press it into its shape roughly

61
00:06:58,559 --> 00:07:02,528
right so I'm working out how much elastic I need so I put this off to

62
00:07:02,559 --> 00:07:05,216
my face bearing might there's a one sent him to see a lance

63
00:07:06,816 --> 00:07:09,727
that I've just measured that had formed in the last time

64
00:07:11,552 --> 00:07:11,552
I

65
00:07:12,735 --> 00:07:22,528
gonna do around the day that you might umbles which is about eighteen centimeters

66
00:07:23,712 --> 00:07:24,127
waiting

67
00:07:25,984 --> 00:07:29,727
but this whole real it kind of looks like I've been holding the last iha but

68
00:07:29,791 --> 00:07:30,463
I had it is

69
00:07:31,615 --> 00:07:36,671
specimen unfunny cheek sometimes last the clothes we went right so I felt to and then

70
00:07:37,376 --> 00:07:38,239
what I'm going to do

71
00:07:39,839 --> 00:07:41,471
is stop them inside

72
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:44,384
she'd be honest can do

73
00:07:49,503 --> 00:07:51,167
well that's a can add a filter

74
00:07:52,575 --> 00:07:54,528
so I'm just gonna put it there the bottom

75
00:07:55,839 --> 00:08:00,320
right then bustle and long gonna use a patient again the main as she were gonna

76
00:08:00,351 --> 00:08:04,832
have it is we have good the pleats yet but the elastic brunch and into the

77
00:08:04,928 --> 00:08:07,648
nearest we might accidentally stick from the last

78
00:08:34,656 --> 00:08:38,047
because my machine doesn't like this at last it that much your very best going from

79
00:08:38,111 --> 00:08:39,424
the middle to the edge

80
00:08:41,664 --> 00:08:45,599
to keep in mind with

81
00:08:47,072 --> 00:10:13,760
the center imports the city

82
00:10:19,296 --> 00:10:20,831
folks were this manics teams meeting

83
00:10:22,559 --> 00:10:24,223
seven just grasslike

84
00:10:25,599 --> 00:10:28,447
and now I'm going to mark where the pleats are going to be

85
00:10:46,559 --> 00:10:47,072
have you ever

86
00:11:02,047 --> 00:11:14,304
been around have not to sing at the time and I already clients the share that

87
00:11:14,335 --> 00:11:16,992
is true I just do your in time was

88
00:11:20,383 --> 00:11:24,927
right so the measurements to need back to the spirit down the side and then just

89
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:27,392
make a little parks they hope the zero to the top

90
00:11:32,351 --> 00:11:33,632
like said to the dates you need to

91
00:11:34,752 --> 00:11:37,184
move that talk point to the second point

92
00:11:44,416 --> 00:11:46,143
and then repeat to the next to Marcus

93
00:11:48,383 --> 00:11:50,239
you start with that point to the second

94
00:12:21,536 --> 00:12:26,208
you are stitching the side so one sent me to away gentilities that guide it is

95
00:12:26,656 --> 00:12:30,559
getting a bit funny though with the elastic again but what I do is stop a

96
00:12:30,624 --> 00:12:36,223
little bit further down and then back attack over it and then stop and hopefully work

97
00:13:06,047 --> 00:13:08,927
he just needs to the china surgent if you fall again half

98
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:10,815
the ever speak

99
00:13:13,151 --> 00:13:15,424
to the other way about the logical the city

100
00:13:17,536 --> 00:13:18,656
and then if you bring it up to hear

101
00:13:20,064 --> 00:13:24,192
from one of these you just need five centimeters you need tomorrow we can use one

102
00:13:24,255 --> 00:13:25,504
of the square is my second

103
00:13:27,552 --> 00:13:29,375
and then you just use put it on each

104
00:13:30,656 --> 00:13:32,927
and so try not to put together

105
00:13:48,031 --> 00:13:51,296
we cut your precious you got you wearing quite a lot of thank you

106
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:52,416
for

107
00:13:56,255 --> 00:13:59,328
the final that his pen the nose wiring

108
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:03,104
so if you go to the back of your

109
00:14:04,447 --> 00:14:08,031
mask it's gotten openings that you can bet a filter in it if you want to

110
00:14:09,184 --> 00:14:12,864
but this is the way to access that channel we've just created

111
00:14:26,304 --> 00:14:27,776
well you know what I cannot say down

112
00:14:28,864 --> 00:14:32,736
it's a good stories and been in the right

113
00:14:38,047 --> 00:14:38,752
questions that

114
00:14:40,607 --> 00:14:42,015
god may the tapes the heart

115
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:46,591
you need to delay

116
00:14:47,935 --> 00:14:49,599
or it's not effective but some graph were

117
00:14:51,231 --> 00:14:52,447
is that all right the last equity

118
00:14:59,455 --> 00:15:04,479
was so close so we'll have to prepare this or camera I just stitch on the

119
00:15:04,607 --> 00:15:04,992
outside

120
00:15:06,656 --> 00:15:11,328
I did say needed to reported and I needed to tell an outline it was excellent

121
00:15:11,648 --> 00:15:12,479
once really good to

122
00:15:17,471 --> 00:15:19,392
us or so machine still is sets off

123
00:15:20,607 --> 00:15:24,000
I see what people mean about and he's not steaming of the glasses

124
00:15:28,512 --> 00:15:29,791
somebody told me to reinforce

125
00:15:32,192 --> 00:15:32,736
after a quick

126
00:15:35,135 --> 00:15:38,656
where because one but he says maybe she'd seen that

127
00:15:40,831 --> 00:15:43,135
she was right but what you think of it there it's

128
00:15:45,760 --> 00:15:47,200
what I can do it's Tyler or not

129
00:15:48,671 --> 00:15:50,815
that's what I've done mind and I think I've done it it to time

130
00:15:56,992 --> 00:15:59,328
I personally felt like this one that's much better

131
00:16:00,447 --> 00:16:01,888
than the one I made my mom

132
00:16:03,296 --> 00:16:06,880
yeah it seems to be quite well there I quite like the fleet's because you can

133
00:16:06,943 --> 00:16:07,392
still talk

134
00:16:09,184 --> 00:16:14,047
so over all I'm really happy with this face mask I did next time as you

135
00:16:14,143 --> 00:16:18,880
noticed I've tried a couple of knots in my hat elastic next time I will probably

136
00:16:19,007 --> 00:16:24,671
cut the elastic eventual to so that it's better and but I mean this is a

137
00:16:24,703 --> 00:16:28,192
good point if you do make one with elastic and you're a bit too generous with

138
00:16:28,223 --> 00:16:32,447
the elastic you can just tie a knot in it and make it shorter so I

139
00:16:32,512 --> 00:16:37,695
think it's really good design and as you can see you know feel like but different

140
00:16:37,791 --> 00:16:42,848
face shapes and if it's both of us which is I'm very positive I think the

141
00:16:42,911 --> 00:16:47,007
pleats work well so the one I did before didn't have pleats but I think it

142
00:16:47,104 --> 00:16:50,400
works well because then it has a bit a gift so that you can talk while

143
00:16:50,432 --> 00:16:51,039
you or sat on

144
00:16:52,192 --> 00:16:52,671
to reach him

145
00:16:56,831 --> 00:17:01,151
if you want to mbs you can see like they hadn't slowed on the sewing machine

146
00:17:01,247 --> 00:17:04,608
for fourteen years and even then you carry into a huge amount of saving

147
00:17:05,696 --> 00:17:06,336
souls or did you

148
00:17:07,615 --> 00:17:10,463
know so I mean you know you managed to make one will we see we did

149
00:17:10,527 --> 00:17:15,839
have a slight debacle with the elastic and but you did manage to make answer is

150
00:17:16,576 --> 00:17:21,151
a fairly to get a friendly project which is a social yeah I don't ricin if

151
00:17:21,183 --> 00:17:24,416
you made it with the ties it would be more big in a friendly because that's

152
00:17:24,447 --> 00:17:30,432
probably the most challenging thing because we have changed the ties to elastic it meant that

153
00:17:30,719 --> 00:17:33,696
we had to be careful that we didn't stitch it into the scene I like the

154
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:39,423
fact that you can put wiring to shakes the nose it's obviously a really beneficial feature

155
00:17:39,552 --> 00:17:44,000
to make sure that you've got the best of it on your mask and it's great

156
00:17:44,063 --> 00:17:48,223
that you can remove it for when you want to wash it and yeah I just

157
00:17:48,255 --> 00:17:51,968
think it's really nice that it's from one rectangle to it doesn't take long to cut

158
00:17:52,031 --> 00:17:57,151
out the last in peace to London and yes so you have got this opening firstly

159
00:17:57,183 --> 00:18:01,504
to get the wire at the top out but also you can't get a filter and

160
00:18:01,631 --> 00:18:05,024
I think I don't know it's the government or I start on the BBC website but

161
00:18:05,088 --> 00:18:06,784
you can use a bit of a

162
00:18:07,871 --> 00:18:09,823
kitchen towel in laughter is the filter

163
00:18:10,975 --> 00:18:11,680
how that works

164
00:18:17,183 --> 00:18:20,735
but yeah sorry happy that I think now that we've traveled up I'd be quite happy

165
00:18:20,832 --> 00:18:22,751
to and batch make a funeral

166
00:18:23,776 --> 00:18:24,927
and be making another one

167
00:18:26,368 --> 00:18:26,432
be

168
00:18:29,183 --> 00:18:32,095
yeah but you need you need like a couple of those this one's in the wash

169
00:18:32,511 --> 00:18:35,712
the Latins in the wash and this might be good as well for where we live

170
00:18:35,776 --> 00:18:38,719
could there are quite a lot of narrow lanes well you can't beating me to the

171
00:18:38,784 --> 00:18:42,432
what you do meet someone so it will mean that you know you could wear this

172
00:18:42,751 --> 00:18:47,040
and east through that path the hair that's all crafty late for this so I'm and

173
00:18:47,072 --> 00:18:51,135
a bit of a religion and them in addition there I guess it's also a so

174
00:18:51,232 --> 00:18:54,432
a review for this because I don't know if anyone else and feeling this but I'm

175
00:18:54,527 --> 00:18:59,712
feeling about face mask passed in overwhelm because there were so many on life I just

176
00:18:59,839 --> 00:19:03,647
couldn't decide the ages which wanted to choose I really just wanted to find one that

177
00:19:03,712 --> 00:19:08,319
works nicely that I could rely on and this one sets the belt so yeah I

178
00:19:08,416 --> 00:19:14,848
definitely reprimand it and yeah you could definitely substitute elastic for the ties in the baston

179
00:19:15,104 --> 00:19:19,423
right so I think that's it for this time you so yeah so we'll be back

180
00:19:19,488 --> 00:19:23,232
soon with another video but for now thanks arching like into shrine
