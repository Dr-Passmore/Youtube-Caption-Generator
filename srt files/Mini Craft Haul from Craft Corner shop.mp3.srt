hello its Clary from copper creations I just thought I'd show with you some of the

1
00:00:13,696 --> 00:00:19,360
ice and I purchase today I had a few gift vouchers to use locally at across

2
00:00:19,423 --> 00:00:22,624
the store and so I brought a few things but I wouldn't normally

3
00:00:24,992 --> 00:00:30,847
so the first thing and I decided by and was this wolf I've got lots of

4
00:00:30,912 --> 00:00:37,152
young and which is why I've chosen the stash bust it by making a giant through

5
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:43,743
which you might have seen if you follow me on Instagram and this through need three

6
00:00:43,776 --> 00:00:45,855
hundred seventy well I'm about

7
00:00:46,944 --> 00:00:53,664
around two hundred twenty square complete and then of receivers all the I'm showing all crocheting

8
00:00:53,728 --> 00:00:59,712
it up together to do at the end and with this I noticed that unless I've

9
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:02,080
got the more yellow yarner I'd

10
00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:08,255
not have much yellow in it and as it's my favorite color I decided that we

11
00:01:08,416 --> 00:01:08,991
best to

12
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:16,767
avoid that scenario and get a little bit more yarn just to even out the colors

13
00:01:17,279 --> 00:01:22,400
at the end so with this through it is going to be a whole random range

14
00:01:22,559 --> 00:01:27,328
I am going to use up lots of the oddments I've got in my own collection

15
00:01:27,487 --> 00:01:31,391
but hopefully it will still look nice as well

16
00:01:32,991 --> 00:01:35,903
be that the first three purchases

17
00:01:37,344 --> 00:01:44,608
another iseum I decided to get I were these pencil brushes so and they are designed

18
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:51,776
for and when you have paints through a sense of however I'll probably use it more

19
00:01:51,935 --> 00:01:57,664
for any text our work I do so I quite like and having a go at

20
00:01:57,760 --> 00:02:01,599
some textile pieces I'm using fabric paint

21
00:02:03,263 --> 00:02:09,792
you know different items to print on to fabric as well as the block printing and

22
00:02:10,016 --> 00:02:10,143
so

23
00:02:11,423 --> 00:02:17,567
that you probably just use these and to to dab paint on without a stencil as

24
00:02:17,632 --> 00:02:19,936
well so yeah so I'd give those ago

25
00:02:24,384 --> 00:02:27,936
another eyes are my goal was this some small bag of

26
00:02:29,503 --> 00:02:37,119
plastic darning needle so in here there's five darning needles I just thought this would be

27
00:02:37,408 --> 00:02:38,688
quite useful because

28
00:02:40,447 --> 00:02:41,759
only can never have too many

29
00:02:43,807 --> 00:02:50,559
they're quite good but if you're traveling because you know they're definitely I mean Nishant you

30
00:02:50,623 --> 00:02:56,063
shouldn't have a problem bringing a muscle blunt darning needle on a plane anyway but at

31
00:02:56,095 --> 00:02:56,671
least I'm

32
00:02:58,399 --> 00:03:02,432
you know you definitely won't have a problem with these and see you there just and

33
00:03:02,496 --> 00:03:03,871
basically they'll help me

34
00:03:05,951 --> 00:03:10,111
we've been all the least end of my croche where's and any other cratering or I'm

35
00:03:10,432 --> 00:03:14,432
going project that's are coming up so that that

36
00:03:17,792 --> 00:03:24,384
the second last item I'm going to show no the third to laugh is this I'm

37
00:03:24,544 --> 00:03:29,535
home for maker there I've already got if you Pompeian makers I've got

38
00:03:30,656 --> 00:03:33,216
these clover ones and where

39
00:03:34,656 --> 00:03:40,447
they essentially they come out and the to have you want wrap the wall around them

40
00:03:41,951 --> 00:03:43,679
and then you put them back into the circle

41
00:03:45,503 --> 00:03:49,535
anywhere I'm sure and some of you've seen these before and so this is just a

42
00:03:49,632 --> 00:03:55,199
different design I thought I'd see whether I'm it was a bit easier to use perhaps

43
00:03:55,296 --> 00:03:56,031
or you know

44
00:03:57,087 --> 00:04:02,048
if it was any different at all so you can make a five cents meter dire

45
00:04:02,143 --> 00:04:04,800
Mr one and three cents meter one

46
00:04:05,824 --> 00:04:13,600
it looks similar concepts to and have seen online where people use a fork make compounds

47
00:04:14,272 --> 00:04:20,096
and so is essentially the same concept but I'm branded as a Pombal maker

48
00:04:23,071 --> 00:04:26,208
okay so next I've got these

49
00:04:27,295 --> 00:04:30,911
textile paints I've never seen this particular

50
00:04:32,223 --> 00:04:34,783
brand before it's just called textile color

51
00:04:35,839 --> 00:04:40,544
so I've got three just to see what they're like so I've got a neon-yellow and

52
00:04:40,608 --> 00:04:47,743
the own green and an orange I've already got some other fabric pinks in my collection

53
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:49,119
and little

54
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:53,920
trying to think what's the branded they might be dialogue

55
00:04:55,455 --> 00:04:57,984
but yeah I just thought I'd see what these are like I'm

56
00:04:59,679 --> 00:05:04,640
as with other fabric paints you fix them by acetum

57
00:05:06,303 --> 00:05:11,519
on the fabric with an iron and then they say that their washable I'm up to

58
00:05:11,648 --> 00:05:12,447
forty degrees

59
00:05:14,208 --> 00:05:15,200
portative resources

60
00:05:18,592 --> 00:05:24,480
my final purchase that I'm going to show is these texel painter pens so

61
00:05:26,239 --> 00:05:28,511
the thing I liked about these is that

62
00:05:29,951 --> 00:05:34,720
they're quite narrow there one to millimeter and lines that they draw

63
00:05:35,967 --> 00:05:40,063
you get a range colors we've got black greens blue

64
00:05:41,536 --> 00:05:42,432
red and yellow

65
00:05:43,776 --> 00:05:47,743
just to be interesting to see what they're like whether it's a bit easier to create

66
00:05:47,808 --> 00:05:49,631
the fine blind and

67
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:56,032
and like the fabric paints again you wait for it to drive this Davis and take

68
00:05:56,096 --> 00:06:02,592
about an hour and then you iron-on at the three minutes without using team and then

69
00:06:02,656 --> 00:06:07,648
it should be fixed on to your fabric and then again you can wash apparently the

70
00:06:07,712 --> 00:06:09,055
fabric a pretty degrees

71
00:06:12,544 --> 00:06:18,496
okay that's all of my purchases from today so just a small little collection of random

72
00:06:18,592 --> 00:06:22,048
textile lightens they hopefully I'll be able to use them scenes

73
00:06:23,167 --> 00:06:29,023
and you know trial them out to see whether they're worth well and that there now

74
00:06:29,183 --> 00:06:29,600
that's it
