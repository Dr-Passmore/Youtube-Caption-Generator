hello and stays with you I'm reviewing this share puzzle if you like this video and

1
00:00:04,607 --> 00:00:07,967
would like to see more please don't think it's a like unsubscribe take the shot that

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:13,503
I've done here is the new look six to three to and I have done variation

3
00:00:13,663 --> 00:00:19,583
sea or place to to variation see the variation to this person has to share variations

4
00:00:19,743 --> 00:00:20,224
from for

5
00:00:21,631 --> 00:00:27,488
a woman's fitted shirt and then its course the men's old unisex shirts of this well

6
00:00:28,063 --> 00:00:29,087
as a and be

7
00:00:30,239 --> 00:00:33,055
so that was the reason I thought it I thought it might be with will best

8
00:00:33,088 --> 00:00:34,976
style if I did want to make my foreigner

9
00:00:36,799 --> 00:00:42,591
someone else a shirt I'm in a blur of options having a couple of different styles

10
00:00:43,104 --> 00:00:46,880
I decided to the women's Shepperton on this occasion district I'm doing it is part of

11
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:53,408
course locally I felt that heavenly added dots the and that bestaat and backlots would be

12
00:00:53,504 --> 00:00:58,240
quite interesting for is only men's version there is a box place of the back which

13
00:00:58,368 --> 00:01:02,880
overseas an interesting element of world and by the walnuts occasion holding a woman's version of

14
00:01:02,944 --> 00:01:06,592
fat and like a bitter as I went along in the but since I want to

15
00:01:06,655 --> 00:01:11,519
have someone like though that but in future and then I've also got a man's version

16
00:01:11,903 --> 00:01:16,064
one hand so I cast out a sizable team I did to a slight adjustment which

17
00:01:16,223 --> 00:01:19,680
I'll explain later it's a for the fabric that I've used here I'd use this lovely

18
00:01:19,776 --> 00:01:26,367
cotton Copeland fabric is a bus of light prints in the at work alway and I

19
00:01:26,496 --> 00:01:31,903
think it's still available on the neighbor Kroft website so I will link it possibly in

20
00:01:31,935 --> 00:01:37,055
my blog post if you do want to look at that fabric and I've added some

21
00:01:37,152 --> 00:01:45,087
contrast of but some yellow here for the sleeve Blackett's of lines bearcats with this yellow

22
00:01:45,248 --> 00:01:50,143
cotton Copland underneath the color is this is because the bottom and

23
00:01:53,536 --> 00:01:55,167
you can see I've also done the

24
00:01:58,015 --> 00:01:58,592
condor stand

25
00:01:59,872 --> 00:02:03,807
in that Ellie fabric as well so just a quick night on the fabric I've never

26
00:02:03,872 --> 00:02:09,087
actually used any fabric from the pneumograph before and but yeah I really like this possible

27
00:02:09,151 --> 00:02:14,559
I print it looked slightly differently image on the screen one I was looking at it

28
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:19,520
but actually it's probably an even better color in person then what I thought it was

29
00:02:19,583 --> 00:02:23,647
going to look like so I'm actually things with that results it's really nice to work

30
00:02:23,712 --> 00:02:28,063
clear it's easy to press and it looks like a silly to wash and I have

31
00:02:28,128 --> 00:02:32,735
prewashed it so that came out fine it it easy to iron afterwards and dental the

32
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:38,335
steps I've been able to oppressor where required same with the yellow fabrics so the yellow

33
00:02:38,464 --> 00:02:44,960
fabric I've got much more likely to me so there's a shopful to fabrics which I

34
00:02:45,024 --> 00:02:48,320
didn't go into an awful up because I've got so much fabric of my sash I

35
00:02:48,416 --> 00:02:52,031
don't need to shop for fabric waste of time I just shot my stash I did

36
00:02:52,095 --> 00:02:57,600
want fabric that would complement this botfly print and I didn't have one in a similar

37
00:02:57,664 --> 00:03:01,119
wait I'm so it was quite nice because I had the bus of like recovered by

38
00:03:01,184 --> 00:03:05,343
that point so I could bring it with me and try and find a yellow that

39
00:03:05,472 --> 00:03:08,735
went lightly with them I did try to see if I could match any of the

40
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:13,279
other colors because I do typically elevate twenty-one I thought maybe I should you know branch

41
00:03:13,343 --> 00:03:16,800
out me again orange to go with us and but I can find an orange so

42
00:03:17,248 --> 00:03:21,087
I had to get a bit slimily and I had to go with my duffel of

43
00:03:21,535 --> 00:03:26,815
having yellow which to be bad it's my favorite color place that's court and yeah I've

44
00:03:26,848 --> 00:03:31,423
used a yellow blossoms one here as well and which were actually from my such which

45
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:33,951
is quite happy good Buster's are really expensive

46
00:03:35,072 --> 00:03:38,527
in certain shops so great thing is it's all made up cause of buttons and I

47
00:03:38,591 --> 00:03:42,496
think the watchman instructions of the things of both fabrics so it should be fine to

48
00:03:42,591 --> 00:03:47,199
wash and gave them in terms of difficulty I found this very challenging make this is

49
00:03:47,264 --> 00:03:52,000
probably the most complications make that I've ever done there is none saying that is there

50
00:03:52,095 --> 00:03:56,352
are just so many elements to it's so it's a nice fabric to work with its

51
00:03:56,416 --> 00:04:02,623
very stable as its the cotton woven fabric as I mentioned it's it's easy to press

52
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:07,455
the dtr about that it's not slippery or anything like that but there's just so many

53
00:04:07,552 --> 00:04:10,815
elements to it so I had to do and the bus stops which actually his in

54
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:15,679
a bit by being patch pockets yeah there are patch pockets as well there's also these

55
00:04:15,871 --> 00:04:22,111
I'm dots on the back which you have to stitch up as the yoke the L

56
00:04:22,208 --> 00:04:27,455
d sermon sleeve Puckett's which were interesting to do there are the cups and and then

57
00:04:27,584 --> 00:04:31,679
call she got the collar with this them top section as well and you've got the

58
00:04:31,712 --> 00:04:37,279
front band not to mention I think this person has eleven button holds and the little

59
00:04:37,343 --> 00:04:39,007
buttons living with it so

60
00:04:40,223 --> 00:04:42,399
that was probably the better almost

61
00:04:43,936 --> 00:04:47,743
wrecked all the work and the intubations it turns out I thought I wasn't about the

62
00:04:47,808 --> 00:04:53,664
button house but when you've got eleven ahead of you it is quite daunting so yeah

63
00:04:54,144 --> 00:04:57,824
this was a really child you make for me and did pick it on purpose because

64
00:04:57,855 --> 00:05:00,640
I was doing it in a class and I wanted to learn on these techniques so

65
00:05:00,832 --> 00:05:06,048
I felt like a really grown making the shirts as it is such a technical peace

66
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:11,712
esthetical garment and then how many mix you've made so far it's probably not want to

67
00:05:11,808 --> 00:05:15,615
start straight away but saying that I'm really pleased with that I did pick on purpose

68
00:05:15,743 --> 00:05:20,096
as I mentioned because of all the different techniques in its it's also got a calves

69
00:05:20,384 --> 00:05:24,992
and comes to him at the bottom which is another challenging element so you could of

70
00:05:25,088 --> 00:05:29,216
course get many share patterns which are just flat at the bottom and that would be

71
00:05:29,536 --> 00:05:34,015
a lot easier to him but saying that I really like that it don't have

72
00:05:35,359 --> 00:05:39,104
kept him so there's a lot of work in it but obviously if that's what you

73
00:05:39,167 --> 00:05:39,808
want initial

74
00:05:40,895 --> 00:05:44,447
you're gonna read the more one one sits on in times of clerisy thing instructions I

75
00:05:44,671 --> 00:05:50,272
did not find the instructions with listening look Patton that supporter follow there were definitely a

76
00:05:50,335 --> 00:05:56,928
couple of points in particular with and fitting the sleeves into the armfuls which just kind

77
00:05:56,992 --> 00:06:00,032
of left you to it so there is a bit of a seemed knowledge it didn't

78
00:06:00,063 --> 00:06:03,424
tell you had to fit the sleeve and say you know when you put a couple

79
00:06:03,519 --> 00:06:07,839
ease of stitching and to you then and draw it in to gather slightly but not

80
00:06:07,903 --> 00:06:13,631
enough so that you are visible gathers it's just to ease this into the armhole it

81
00:06:13,664 --> 00:06:18,303
didn't tell you how to do that at all so that's something to bear in mind

82
00:06:18,368 --> 00:06:23,007
to you know to do belabouring research there and all they saying that it didn't I

83
00:06:23,104 --> 00:06:27,264
don't think even said about using it and it just literally said stitch it into the

84
00:06:27,359 --> 00:06:32,000
our home and she definitely needed to hear it in so and if you want aware

85
00:06:32,096 --> 00:06:38,399
of easing these Steventon aho that could throw you off of it and on that step

86
00:06:38,592 --> 00:06:42,687
but saying that's when I had to follow the instructions for the sleep bucket I've never

87
00:06:42,752 --> 00:06:46,432
done one of these are my lungs and I was really don't it by it but

88
00:06:46,496 --> 00:06:52,320
actually the instructions and we're fine I just took it really slow really concentrated on each

89
00:06:52,384 --> 00:06:56,511
step take it easy and it came out perfect that time so yeah it is a

90
00:06:56,575 --> 00:07:01,727
mixed bag on clarity release some of it was quite there some of it knots and

91
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:06,752
it does tell you while at the end of our Larry's fissioning the button-holes if you

92
00:07:06,816 --> 00:07:10,463
need to but it doesn't actually give you any guidance or advice on that so I

93
00:07:10,528 --> 00:07:16,096
mean I adjusted my discuss and from researching online you can get a bit of a

94
00:07:16,256 --> 00:07:21,984
date if you don't have a at Boston I'm right and along your boss voice so

95
00:07:22,463 --> 00:07:26,911
I thought I better adjust that and then I had the logistical high Maratha interment reposition

96
00:07:26,976 --> 00:07:32,415
the rest evenly so yeah my effective that added of it guidance on how to position

97
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:36,415
your buttons or to make sure the fit was correct but again perhaps they're just assuming

98
00:07:36,544 --> 00:07:40,384
that you already know that you're so I found it interesting that law because I was

99
00:07:40,447 --> 00:07:44,544
looking at a couple of reference books at home when I was doing this to work

100
00:07:44,640 --> 00:07:48,351
out the position of the Aston's as well and so I would have a little bit

101
00:07:48,384 --> 00:07:51,872
ever read up if you do have the past and white doesn't give you much guidance

102
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:55,071
on the button and I definitely like quite a lot I think I licked to three

103
00:07:55,135 --> 00:08:00,096
different reference works in the end and yeah it's really useful in the design and fit

104
00:08:00,256 --> 00:08:03,648
I kind of gone through a lot of the divine features there was a mentioned the

105
00:08:03,776 --> 00:08:07,967
color deports there's that for and top button

106
00:08:09,247 --> 00:08:14,432
it on the potter there's the front bands you've got the cuffs and there are two

107
00:08:14,528 --> 00:08:18,752
buttons on the cuffs which is less you got a specific sleep bucket here which is

108
00:08:18,816 --> 00:08:25,055
really nice and because submit that person's you just fault is over to fold over twice

109
00:08:25,824 --> 00:08:30,399
and which is nice as well but I quite like this I'm design feature there's a

110
00:08:30,496 --> 00:08:36,064
couple piece on each the what the front boss starts a couple of patch pockets gusli

111
00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:40,192
could just put one on if you wanted and and yeah you got the good

112
00:08:42,591 --> 00:08:47,583
you've got the two back dots as well and discount time so I did choose it

113
00:08:47,616 --> 00:08:51,807
because I wanted its many show features as possible and as a mentioned on my make

114
00:08:51,903 --> 00:08:56,736
nine I would like to make a shirt a man's shirt by the end of the

115
00:08:56,768 --> 00:09:00,607
yet so this has been amazing practice for that in terms of fit the you pass

116
00:09:00,703 --> 00:09:06,143
in fits really well in the class I was recommended to take it in a vantage

117
00:09:06,432 --> 00:09:10,976
on either side which I have done but I don't think it would necessarily looked at

118
00:09:11,039 --> 00:09:16,255
that birds if I had slept the extra women or perhaps I didn't need to take

119
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:19,903
up white so much as an inch but in the next time if I did make

120
00:09:19,968 --> 00:09:23,903
myself another one I probably only take carpet and either side to the in inches quite

121
00:09:23,935 --> 00:09:28,575
a lot I also decided to use French themes on the inside and I'm not sure

122
00:09:28,607 --> 00:09:31,776
if I follow with that next time time taken as a really difficult one because I've

123
00:09:31,807 --> 00:09:35,744
been gradually doing it over the last three and a half months it definitely take me

124
00:09:35,807 --> 00:09:39,135
well to cut out that take me about three and a half hours so there are

125
00:09:39,168 --> 00:09:42,432
quite a few pieces to cut out but then I am quite slow a meticulous at

126
00:09:42,463 --> 00:09:47,072
that stage so and to someone who's a bit more confident that could probably do it

127
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:50,911
in a much all the time this person is a really good slow burner that makes

128
00:09:50,943 --> 00:09:55,424
them so you could really take it into small sections if you did just want to

129
00:09:55,487 --> 00:10:00,000
focus on a bit one week for you know one evening and you can really break

130
00:10:00,064 --> 00:10:04,096
it down into sections so I'm as I mentioned it's very typical so you can just

131
00:10:04,127 --> 00:10:07,296
gonna go what going to do this particular you know but you I'm going to do

132
00:10:07,424 --> 00:10:11,872
the sleep packet's over the next day getting there are so many different little elements to

133
00:10:11,935 --> 00:10:15,935
it it's quite a nice and project to do over a period of time and so

134
00:10:16,223 --> 00:10:22,304
without have taken quite a bit of time it's been really nice to just keep rolling

135
00:10:22,367 --> 00:10:26,495
on with it sometimes it's really tempting to just really bash their project or really quickly

136
00:10:26,559 --> 00:10:30,239
whereas this one I have just taken my time and go through out other thing to

137
00:10:30,271 --> 00:10:35,168
mention that this actually is that the sleeve spent me fine and sometimes I find that

138
00:10:36,031 --> 00:10:40,192
I'm buying stuff in a store that this leaves the too short for me so it

139
00:10:40,255 --> 00:10:43,424
might be there when someone else the sleeves that you don't bet that's by an easy

140
00:10:43,487 --> 00:10:47,263
adjustment that you can make so overall I think it's a really nice captain if you

141
00:10:47,359 --> 00:10:50,943
want all of these shirt features in there and bogusly if you do want to pick

142
00:10:51,007 --> 00:10:54,656
and choose there might be a simple one out there for you and it was assume

143
00:10:54,719 --> 00:10:59,616
a bit of prior knowledge so I wouldn't say it's a complete beginners guide your very

144
00:10:59,679 --> 00:11:03,935
best going for a different shirt person that is designed for beginners or perhaps again a

145
00:11:03,968 --> 00:11:07,392
few other projects and do about beforehand I'm not sure if I'd make another one again

146
00:11:07,487 --> 00:11:11,872
just because I don't like a awful locksets I don't do a job which requires me

147
00:11:11,968 --> 00:11:16,223
to be really smart and formal and to be on it in this fabric I'm not

148
00:11:16,288 --> 00:11:20,671
a shorter it would even class but as this muncher again I do wine or flow

149
00:11:20,831 --> 00:11:25,888
shirts in my free time either I think quite many own one other end it's way

150
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:29,440
more casual than this and that been really fun to make it and I do think

151
00:11:29,504 --> 00:11:34,880
I will wear this one unlike my special chess and yeah I'm quite looking forward to

152
00:11:35,168 --> 00:11:40,127
making one possibly fulfilled in the near future he did ask me to make him one
