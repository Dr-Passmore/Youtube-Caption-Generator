00:00:00,351 --> 00:00:05,056
hello today I'm going to go through the top tips that I have the crafting with

1
00:00:05,087 --> 00:00:09,951
the credit illness so oversee there are lots of different chronic illnesses and that one that

2
00:00:10,015 --> 00:00:14,144
I've got is not really a graphic ankylosing spondylitis which are all

3
00:00:15,232 --> 00:00:20,544
from now on described as a yes because it's a lot quicker and harder to mispronounce

4
00:00:21,152 --> 00:00:26,944
so with asked it's an autoimmune disease it's also so a form of arthritis it's essentially

5
00:00:26,975 --> 00:00:32,383
where your body's attacking your spine and which in the end results in the worst from

6
00:00:32,448 --> 00:00:38,271
your spine fuzing so as a result there's a lot of chronic pain involved and not

7
00:00:38,335 --> 00:00:42,495
just in the spine it can effect on that for a free joints including your iris

8
00:00:43,136 --> 00:00:48,416
and which I think I've mentioned briefly as a previous video so the main issue that

9
00:00:48,512 --> 00:00:53,119
I have is that I get extreme fatigue and I do have to monitor so that

10
00:00:53,183 --> 00:00:57,088
I don't get I have bad pain symptoms as well

11
00:00:58,175 --> 00:01:03,136
so anyway it's these tips are what I personally find useful obviously anyone who has a

12
00:01:03,167 --> 00:01:09,279
chronic illness or anyone you know dealing I'm with an ownness at the time there it's

13
00:01:09,344 --> 00:01:14,304
obviously I'm trial and error to just to point out what works for and these are

14
00:01:14,367 --> 00:01:18,527
just the things that I personally found useful and I thought I would share its I'm

15
00:01:18,592 --> 00:01:24,192
gonna go through six different points so the first one is to do your physio exercises

16
00:01:24,255 --> 00:01:28,543
so this doesn't sound very crop paste and but I do feel like it strongly linked

17
00:01:28,639 --> 00:01:32,255
my productivity and how productive I am with my craft

18
00:01:33,599 --> 00:01:37,311
when I first got like those with us and before I got diagnosed with the as

19
00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:43,103
I did have fideo exciters I've been to physio on two occasions that two different hospitals

20
00:01:43,935 --> 00:01:49,984
and I've got to be honest when I finally started going to regular Hugo lessons and

21
00:01:50,015 --> 00:01:57,407
then after that I started really taking my physio and stretches and strengthening exercises seriously I

22
00:01:57,536 --> 00:02:05,024
found a significant improvement in my symptoms I still get really tired and I am not

23
00:02:05,503 --> 00:02:11,391
completely without pain all the time I do find that if I do my physio exercises

24
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:12,576
I feel so much better

25
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:17,279
now it is I don't do by the zero structures but say but I do follow

26
00:02:17,376 --> 00:02:21,824
the yoga mat Adrian YouTube channel I find this really useful because a lot of the

27
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:27,679
exercises with in yoga linked to what your taught at physio and a lot of them

28
00:02:27,744 --> 00:02:31,231
are really good feel bad and you know stretching out your hamstrings which can in turn

29
00:02:31,296 --> 00:02:38,175
affect your and how you're back and your posture works so what I do is I'm

30
00:02:38,496 --> 00:02:42,751
will lead with a done channel they provide you with a free calendar and suggests videos

31
00:02:42,848 --> 00:02:46,815
that you can do that each thing so essentially I don't need to think I just

32
00:02:46,848 --> 00:02:49,472
need to follow this calendar she tends to

33
00:02:51,007 --> 00:02:54,111
put them in a plate list as well so it's really easy to find the videos

34
00:02:54,399 --> 00:02:57,408
the role in order and you just need to pick the next one the next day

35
00:02:57,632 --> 00:03:01,408
so I find this really helps because I don't need to think about it keeps it

36
00:03:01,472 --> 00:03:05,632
very because I don't necessarily know what I'm what exercises I'm going to do the next

37
00:03:05,695 --> 00:03:11,904
day it also means that their exercises very so that I'm not just doing the same

38
00:03:11,968 --> 00:03:12,832
ones all the times

39
00:03:14,048 --> 00:03:18,367
the second if I've got it is too it's more I guess I mean paste and

40
00:03:18,464 --> 00:03:23,488
is to cut your fabric on a stable when I first and she is before I

41
00:03:24,063 --> 00:03:28,384
but I goes with the s probably a year and a half before I was making

42
00:03:28,576 --> 00:03:33,216
this and each dress cover up so made up town in fabric and had by sliding

43
00:03:33,376 --> 00:03:35,296
all around the edges and on the top of the pockets

44
00:03:36,352 --> 00:03:39,776
and I did all the talking of the bias been doing I cut it all out

45
00:03:39,839 --> 00:03:42,720
on the floor I text it all on the floor and then I had to attack

46
00:03:42,848 --> 00:03:47,231
the zip up into place when I talked the vivid place I got what about like

47
00:03:47,328 --> 00:03:47,839
sciatica

48
00:03:49,856 --> 00:03:53,567
then I went on a working all the day and just had to face up on

49
00:03:54,143 --> 00:03:59,871
coucal to get through it and which in hindsight probably was the early symptoms of a

50
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:06,207
us but since then I have started I found that my tolerance to casting on the

51
00:04:06,272 --> 00:04:13,279
floor was a lot short and so I couldn't spend prolonged periods cutting out the fort

52
00:04:13,343 --> 00:04:18,592
Wayne angle so I started using a table to cut out fabric which had been put

53
00:04:18,656 --> 00:04:22,111
off with it before just because you're I felt that you'd been limited by the sides

54
00:04:22,144 --> 00:04:26,847
of the table and that's you know I'm it might be harder and some wake of

55
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:30,335
the least on the floor and it can lay all out there are slightly depending on

56
00:04:30,368 --> 00:04:35,743
not much both spaces caught and but this isn't the case I'm there's lots of good

57
00:04:35,839 --> 00:04:38,944
techniques that you can apply you know to make sure that say if you're using a

58
00:04:39,007 --> 00:04:42,399
stretch fabric that you put a child is that it doesn't I'm any of the handle

59
00:04:42,528 --> 00:04:45,023
just stretch and just thought the fabric out of shape

60
00:04:46,783 --> 00:04:50,303
and yeah I found it's really useful don't really go back to the cotton on the

61
00:04:50,368 --> 00:04:56,320
floor unless I really have to and its normally right I see yet I've found that

62
00:04:56,351 --> 00:05:00,032
that's being really useful and I definitely recommend it if you do a lot of sewing

63
00:05:00,575 --> 00:05:04,992
even if you have to uniquely the time one table brief later and to use that

64
00:05:06,399 --> 00:05:11,295
in between meals or something like that can my third tip is to commit to fifteen

65
00:05:11,359 --> 00:05:15,808
minutes of crafting a day so as I mentioned of the to a big issue with

66
00:05:15,872 --> 00:05:21,888
a and other results I find that this affects my motivations him to pursue and complete

67
00:05:22,208 --> 00:05:27,839
projects so what I did I think just over a year ago and the stark both

68
00:05:27,936 --> 00:05:33,343
twenty eighteen I decided to commit to fifteen minutes of serving a day I found this

69
00:05:33,471 --> 00:05:38,111
really useful because it feels like a manageable chunk of time so even if I'm feeling

70
00:05:38,208 --> 00:05:38,976
really shattered

71
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:44,223
I think Oh okay I got fifteen minutes Oh it's just in attacking this seemed together

72
00:05:44,351 --> 00:05:46,208
on I'm gonna save this particular seem

73
00:05:47,231 --> 00:05:50,303
all you know if you're if you trace your passes it could be tracing out of

74
00:05:50,944 --> 00:05:54,687
and you know one of the pattern pieces it does mean that it you know it

75
00:05:54,752 --> 00:06:00,223
takes longer to complete a project and theoretically they're saying that you know if you're pissing

76
00:06:00,287 --> 00:06:05,791
of crafting because you know you're feeling so side it means that you're not getting started

77
00:06:05,855 --> 00:06:10,175
with a straight away anyway and you might find yourself more during by spending a really

78
00:06:10,239 --> 00:06:15,936
other day just solely crafting so in my personal parent second that I was more productive

79
00:06:16,384 --> 00:06:19,455
I actually got some projects off the ground and completed

80
00:06:20,575 --> 00:06:25,727
and yeah just I'm I guess it's a bit more energizing in one respect especially if

81
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:30,656
you restrict yourself to that fifteen minutes because then it kind of inquirers because you want

82
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:33,183
to do more but if you go note that's all I'm doing you look forward to

83
00:06:33,247 --> 00:06:37,216
the next chunk the next day and see it's worth trying out with that especially if

84
00:06:37,247 --> 00:06:42,463
you are circling with motivation to the next to it number four is more to do

85
00:06:42,528 --> 00:06:46,847
with if you do so for propped the long periods of time is to set a

86
00:06:46,944 --> 00:06:53,023
timer to ensure that you do pause and stretch out so I'm do about my own

87
00:06:53,152 --> 00:07:00,223
criticalness with a as and because your spine is ultimately going to fuse together one of

88
00:07:00,351 --> 00:07:05,920
the main preventative measures is to ensure that you retain good postures so that you know

89
00:07:06,048 --> 00:07:10,335
if it does a fuse like as to be stupid and I straight back because historically

90
00:07:10,432 --> 00:07:13,216
that's I'm you know it's known as Mandy spine and

91
00:07:14,463 --> 00:07:16,480
says that classic hunched posture so

92
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:23,967
recently to be very careful that my everyday activities I've got good foster so naturally you

93
00:07:24,032 --> 00:07:29,152
know sitting hunched over a desk going it when I'm cutting out fabric or slumped over

94
00:07:29,216 --> 00:07:33,567
the sewing machine and even you know listing all crocin in front of the TV it's

95
00:07:33,631 --> 00:07:38,432
very easy to search and you know get all twisted round and to not have a

96
00:07:38,496 --> 00:07:44,864
brilliant posture so having an alarm going off just kind of remind you to pause you

97
00:07:44,928 --> 00:07:49,183
know maybe do some stretches even if they'll you know the ones you they recommend you

98
00:07:49,247 --> 00:07:53,951
doing an office you know during some twists all that in your chair so that can

99
00:07:54,303 --> 00:08:00,832
really help just and prevent any damage occurring while you're crafting because it didn't number fibers

100
00:08:00,895 --> 00:08:07,007
to monitor your thoughts and be kind to yourself I think it's very easy to get

101
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:12,799
stuck in a ruts and also and the virally negative thoughts especially if you are an

102
00:08:12,959 --> 00:08:21,088
overachiever so I think the hardest part of my diagnosis is that my mind still wants

103
00:08:21,152 --> 00:08:26,496
to do a hundred different things and it's really inspired and motivated but my body is

104
00:08:26,559 --> 00:08:29,216
not necessarily keeping up with my mindset

105
00:08:30,496 --> 00:08:33,695
and this in turn then makes me feel a bit defeated when I don't get you

106
00:08:33,728 --> 00:08:39,776
know my really long chanceless completed so I mean realistically this is good advice with anyone

107
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:46,400
not just someone with chronic pain or chronic illness but it is worth noticing those thoughts

108
00:08:46,848 --> 00:08:50,528
because they're not going to help you craft as the long run it's gonna make you

109
00:08:50,591 --> 00:08:52,512
think are well there's no point be doing it because you know

110
00:08:53,599 --> 00:08:58,400
I can only achieve that you know x amount I want to achieve twice as much

111
00:08:58,495 --> 00:09:02,015
in that time but you know you can only do what you can at a particular

112
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:03,328
point and

113
00:09:04,479 --> 00:09:10,304
treating yourself harshly and with the way you're talking to some internally it's not going to

114
00:09:10,367 --> 00:09:14,304
help that so I just just be fine to yourself trick us off like you would

115
00:09:14,335 --> 00:09:19,231
a friend as they say and even just observing these negative thoughts can really help you

116
00:09:19,968 --> 00:09:24,799
you know take a step back and notice what you're doing this probably isn't a problem

117
00:09:24,864 --> 00:09:29,440
for everyone but I certainly find the you know I want to do more than I

118
00:09:29,536 --> 00:09:34,176
can and then I'm annoyed at myself but there's not a lot I could do about

119
00:09:34,271 --> 00:09:36,992
it and its best just

120
00:09:38,111 --> 00:09:42,783
you know look after yourself in the final point I felt like I friend someone once

121
00:09:42,848 --> 00:09:45,216
when I was trying to look at waits to

122
00:09:46,719 --> 00:09:52,960
deal with their crashes or I like to say flops that happen so with the fatigue

123
00:09:53,823 --> 00:09:58,880
sometimes I just have a complete crash and this onliest when I'm kind of sprawled out

124
00:09:58,943 --> 00:10:03,359
on this over I've just blocked and I got this from me and not making a

125
00:10:03,392 --> 00:10:09,247
lot to drinks and I just can't do anything so a good idea is to have

126
00:10:09,375 --> 00:10:10,015
some sort of

127
00:10:11,583 --> 00:10:16,992
coping station if that makes sense so and what I've got it I've got my what

128
00:10:17,023 --> 00:10:20,640
at the moment I've got my missing his so it means that if I do drop

129
00:10:21,343 --> 00:10:21,728
normally

130
00:10:23,168 --> 00:10:26,624
I might be able to do a popular reason missing so this is them to sleep

131
00:10:26,656 --> 00:10:29,536
with a guard gonna make at the moment which I started at the beginning

132
00:10:30,656 --> 00:10:32,223
so it's taking a wall and

133
00:10:33,567 --> 00:10:37,984
and anything else to leak how to knit your medication if you take it than

134
00:10:40,927 --> 00:10:44,768
any other things that will provide you with some further perhaps you know he had a

135
00:10:44,864 --> 00:10:46,943
seeker apply it to anyway you brought pain

136
00:10:48,351 --> 00:10:52,223
the remote control so that you can watch something and the I do find that even

137
00:10:52,255 --> 00:10:56,320
having a bit of craft material telling Nick have a bit of hand to broidery it

138
00:10:56,383 --> 00:11:00,127
might be that you can't face going up to the same machine to field shaft into

139
00:11:00,159 --> 00:11:02,335
that it might be that you can you know

140
00:11:03,807 --> 00:11:07,359
do a few and it's a hand in bawdry well you can create a

141
00:11:09,088 --> 00:11:09,856
couple of rounds

142
00:11:11,583 --> 00:11:14,432
even you know have a book here just you can read and that because

143
00:11:15,520 --> 00:11:18,783
you know unfortunately these crashes do happen but it's good to

144
00:11:20,192 --> 00:11:22,656
and plan for them so that you don't feel that but when they do have a

145
00:11:22,719 --> 00:11:27,679
cutting the thing I was ready for this and and then you can just accept the

146
00:11:27,744 --> 00:11:33,280
crash and then hopefully it won't take us long to recover from it in case that's

147
00:11:33,504 --> 00:11:37,728
all the tips of got to provide for Nell and so I hope this is abuse

148
00:11:37,919 --> 00:11:42,080
and some of you I'd like to say I do find the musical personally I might

149
00:11:42,111 --> 00:11:46,432
not follow them all the time but I do have these strategies their own place if

150
00:11:46,463 --> 00:11:47,135
I do need them

151
00:11:48,288 --> 00:11:49,567
thanks watching and seizing
