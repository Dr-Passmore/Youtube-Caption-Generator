00:00:00,671 --> 00:00:03,680
so today's video is a bit of a catcher for Eddie so I'm going to show

1
00:00:03,776 --> 00:00:08,128
you a few things that I've made recently when I say so I'm gonna add some

2
00:00:08,223 --> 00:00:13,152
photos because they there were all gets so I've give them away and I probably get

3
00:00:13,215 --> 00:00:13,855
a hold on to

4
00:00:15,135 --> 00:00:19,104
a few of them for a bit longer but I just go there's on I'm going

5
00:00:19,135 --> 00:00:22,271
to pace them officer that they arrived from time okay so the first one I'm going

6
00:00:22,304 --> 00:00:26,784
to show you is the mickles seven seven eight three which I acquired recently from a

7
00:00:26,815 --> 00:00:32,479
local charity shop it was published in the sixties nineteen sixty-five is the copyright so with

8
00:00:32,576 --> 00:00:37,568
this one I made a view see which is a top and shorts because I thought

9
00:00:37,664 --> 00:00:41,504
I would be nice for my niece I'm and also it's in the correct size for

10
00:00:41,568 --> 00:00:46,847
her I did manage I think my mom managed to measure how briefly when she last

11
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:53,439
visited her so I did double check fats and the measurements matched her so yeah it's

12
00:00:53,535 --> 00:00:59,231
actually a really interesting make because although it looks really simple and to be that probably

13
00:00:59,296 --> 00:01:03,776
didn't take that long it's just that I did short burst of sewing so it is

14
00:01:03,807 --> 00:01:07,648
so promptly took me at least a week of not to and I think why after

15
00:01:07,744 --> 00:01:12,608
I'd cut it out I didn't actually make it for a world because other stuff was

16
00:01:12,671 --> 00:01:17,440
on anyway got my ground to it and made it and I was really happy with

17
00:01:17,503 --> 00:01:22,015
the results and actually it's a really good skill but does though and there are some

18
00:01:22,239 --> 00:01:27,360
more common things Sinead facing to the neckline and the armholes you also it was a

19
00:01:27,424 --> 00:01:31,040
really good to practice compare and thus in incensing is it

20
00:01:32,223 --> 00:01:36,223
because he had to add once the back an interesting point and it actually is that

21
00:01:36,863 --> 00:01:40,991
it's said to put the zip on of the added the facing at the back I

22
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:43,872
don't know if it's because you're working with such small pieces

23
00:01:44,959 --> 00:01:50,496
or not I'm because lonely one eye on a pattern you only have this if you

24
00:01:50,624 --> 00:01:54,335
brought a basic at the back you'd put it on over the lip so you know

25
00:01:54,463 --> 00:01:59,711
those it wouldn't brush against your skin lord beyond show even the on the inside so

26
00:02:00,064 --> 00:02:04,000
yeah I'm not completely sure about that but I'm I can only assume it's because

27
00:02:05,375 --> 00:02:08,608
it's easier if it's only outside to the perhaps because it was quite the school's it

28
00:02:10,048 --> 00:02:14,432
that might be wife and yes there again I said it's really simple but actually on

29
00:02:14,464 --> 00:02:17,151
the shore it's got a really nice detail I didn't know

30
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:21,151
you can see are trying for the line drawing on it but

31
00:02:22,591 --> 00:02:26,975
basically there are two pleats of the front and see your plate on either side of

32
00:02:27,039 --> 00:02:31,776
the front of the shorts and then it's a flat waist band that you attach on

33
00:02:31,839 --> 00:02:36,863
the front of of the place and the back of the waistband had elastic in it

34
00:02:37,151 --> 00:02:40,160
so I thought that was a really nice de sel I have no idea with the

35
00:02:40,671 --> 00:02:45,632
the elastic is the right and lengths for my niece that's the only problem without having

36
00:02:45,888 --> 00:02:51,167
your model there sophister at the time safe and that my bones up and with my

37
00:02:51,264 --> 00:02:55,615
sister at the moment so clear it doesn't fit my home will be there to adjust

38
00:02:55,679 --> 00:02:59,615
it so yeah that's the first one I was really happy with that make and he

39
00:02:59,647 --> 00:03:04,895
had my first about strict with the other make I did recently and was from the

40
00:03:05,055 --> 00:03:10,304
Edward menagerie back and which is why carry law to works in partnership with soft

41
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:15,360
so in this book I basically when my first news was born I made to be

42
00:03:16,063 --> 00:03:19,744
I mean Emma the bunny I had so I thought of my second these

43
00:03:20,832 --> 00:03:27,231
I would make the next person along the cat so I made Alexander the washing to

44
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:31,712
pants similar to you when I make the money passion in this book it's nice and

45
00:03:31,776 --> 00:03:36,320
simple the great thing about making crucial toys is it just feels a bit safer

46
00:03:38,143 --> 00:03:42,912
baby because you're not relying on your own sewing up skills if that makes sense so

47
00:03:43,552 --> 00:03:47,328
I was happy that he had basically you stuffers you go along and so when it

48
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:53,983
starts I'm and then you decrease the net narrows so all the sewing up bits where

49
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:58,496
my part was the face and and attaching the ears of them's until

50
00:03:59,615 --> 00:04:03,871
so it just feels a little bit thing for in that respect and also I'm you

51
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:08,000
use double nets but will I think it's a three millilitre hooks so it's it's quite

52
00:04:08,095 --> 00:04:09,792
tight as well so there are gaps

53
00:04:11,039 --> 00:04:16,415
and obviously I bought some actual toy stuffing CDs and sometimes if I'm just making a

54
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:20,351
mask all that for someone older I just used use a low hill I won't stop

55
00:04:20,415 --> 00:04:24,384
it with that but I did by Bob was toy something for this one so yeah

56
00:04:24,544 --> 00:04:28,480
it was a lovely simple make and the great thing about the Edwards of the naturae

57
00:04:28,575 --> 00:04:31,231
book so this is the first one that there are a few more books out up

58
00:04:32,384 --> 00:04:37,119
I'm hence the other books of a bit more domestic I think that's one dedicated the

59
00:04:37,183 --> 00:04:38,303
dog breeds I'm

60
00:04:40,127 --> 00:04:40,992
not sure about the others

61
00:04:42,687 --> 00:04:46,432
yeah it's really handy actually there's lots of advice in the back of the book about

62
00:04:46,528 --> 00:04:51,743
adding the face details how this can change the personality of the animal you're making I'm

63
00:04:52,799 --> 00:04:58,079
know how to stuff the animal at the end I'm as you go along as well

64
00:04:58,432 --> 00:05:02,944
so with with these stories you only actually put but something in the the base of

65
00:05:03,135 --> 00:05:08,735
the limbs so where the little one wider this is and and that kind of adds

66
00:05:08,832 --> 00:05:13,664
to its particular charming the books really good as long as you do read those other

67
00:05:13,727 --> 00:05:19,359
pages to help you I'm you know so up and stuff it appropriately and it turns

68
00:05:19,424 --> 00:05:22,368
out really well to see I was happy with that and properest the not as well

69
00:05:22,687 --> 00:05:23,295
and the third

70
00:05:24,608 --> 00:05:28,704
project I was going to mention it is that I made some Donald clothes in my

71
00:05:28,832 --> 00:05:34,911
underneath she's I'm going to get a new goal for her birthday so I said star

72
00:05:35,359 --> 00:05:39,200
suggested that I could make some dholes like to go with it so I'm really hoping

73
00:05:39,295 --> 00:05:44,575
the it is again without having the actual dull better hand it is a bit of

74
00:05:44,608 --> 00:05:48,864
a gamble but I just followed the guidance on the back of this person and to

75
00:05:48,928 --> 00:05:54,272
whether it would fit the particular does so I've gone for the medium size the small

76
00:05:54,432 --> 00:05:55,200
medium and large

77
00:05:56,287 --> 00:05:59,424
and I got very chatty version again I think this is from a charity shop but

78
00:05:59,488 --> 00:06:03,328
I don't know when I got it so I'll try and find a better picture from

79
00:06:03,391 --> 00:06:06,303
online and it shows the front cover of it as a

80
00:06:07,359 --> 00:06:14,559
so with this pattern again I'm it was quite nice skill-building pattern just because you

81
00:06:15,743 --> 00:06:20,480
are making everything in miniature and so that was really nice it's also brilliant stash buster

82
00:06:20,575 --> 00:06:25,152
because I managed to use some quite small bits of permanent fabrics I had a mustache

83
00:06:25,312 --> 00:06:29,791
to make these three sets which I probably can have even made place for my based

84
00:06:30,144 --> 00:06:33,855
out of them say I was really happy with that so and yet this is the

85
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:39,839
simplicity five by by for its a sewing patterns the dummy's but I don't know I

86
00:06:39,903 --> 00:06:45,727
wouldn't say it's any easier to read them a regular commercial pattern it seemed pretty much

87
00:06:45,824 --> 00:06:50,175
the same so I don't know why it's the dummy's unless it came with the setting

88
00:06:50,239 --> 00:06:55,391
for domino call I'm not really sure and caught the history as that I think it's

89
00:06:55,903 --> 00:07:00,127
a burly old pattern I'm not sure I'm not even sure I've got the copyright

90
00:07:01,503 --> 00:07:05,888
owner the city thousand Andree it was really nice to make the to mention so the

91
00:07:05,951 --> 00:07:12,928
main skill I practiced on this one it was pretty straightforward overall but you

92
00:07:14,048 --> 00:07:16,320
use bias finding on the

93
00:07:17,567 --> 00:07:22,175
neck opening which I it was a really nice way to practice doing that it was

94
00:07:22,272 --> 00:07:24,608
a tricky round and the shoulder part

95
00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:30,048
Oh yeah that's another point the M the shirt was redolent Rogaland shape as well which

96
00:07:30,144 --> 00:07:33,312
was quite nice but yes he used vice finding him to

97
00:07:34,432 --> 00:07:38,720
cover the rural edge on the next seem so when you you know you stitch it

98
00:07:38,783 --> 00:07:42,847
down so all the bison thing is on the inside and which is a good skilled

99
00:07:42,911 --> 00:07:47,391
practice because of the sea and there are a lot of I don't something just making

100
00:07:47,488 --> 00:07:54,847
patterns which is authentic the other skill was on the panties on the legs you used

101
00:07:55,007 --> 00:07:56,735
elastic to gather it

102
00:07:57,888 --> 00:08:02,208
which is something I've never done on a person before so it was quite nice to

103
00:08:02,528 --> 00:08:02,976
learn that

104
00:08:04,799 --> 00:08:08,223
and also it's just nice to dote because it had a quarter of an inch same

105
00:08:08,287 --> 00:08:13,600
valances so I am I used the overlooker for any scenes that want you know that

106
00:08:13,664 --> 00:08:18,335
wasn't hemming and that so it meant that I didn't have to cut a funny fabric

107
00:08:18,847 --> 00:08:22,880
and so yeah it's a very economical pattern andia it's just a good way to practice

108
00:08:23,104 --> 00:08:27,359
and so me addressed making skills really so the final project that was going to mention

109
00:08:27,519 --> 00:08:32,671
is that I made a penguin towerman Teucer them for my my younger nice

110
00:08:33,728 --> 00:08:38,463
so I got this from the make for baby book which I've shown you my attempts

111
00:08:38,559 --> 00:08:43,968
of a trace of the templates with the sketcher grasso this pattern I really loved their

112
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:48,288
which is why I decide to make it I had she had the pattern in a

113
00:08:48,383 --> 00:08:52,416
magazine but I just couldn't find where the template page was so I could I had

114
00:08:52,479 --> 00:08:55,135
to get the book out the library to get the templates to make the toy a

115
00:08:55,200 --> 00:09:01,504
person and I think yes just like to the facial features on the town that the

116
00:09:01,536 --> 00:09:02,367
pinguin on that part

117
00:09:03,455 --> 00:09:08,736
so it's a really nice make it's pretty simple the instructions are straightforward the only Christmas

118
00:09:08,799 --> 00:09:12,544
and that I would mention on this person is that you have to draw out the

119
00:09:13,088 --> 00:09:13,919
the hood section

120
00:09:15,487 --> 00:09:18,783
so they show you how to lay out on your towel and

121
00:09:20,223 --> 00:09:24,512
they tell you that two of the edges or twenty line I think twenty-nine centimeters long

122
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:27,711
I don't think they told you how wide the other

123
00:09:28,864 --> 00:09:29,375
the other

124
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:36,192
length of the triangle was but he didn't actually highlight that it was a right angle

125
00:09:36,703 --> 00:09:38,783
between the two equal sites

126
00:09:39,807 --> 00:09:44,992
I guess they might be assuming they're your use logic that it's going to get into

127
00:09:45,088 --> 00:09:50,559
the corner of this where that of how that you're going to cut out but because

128
00:09:50,687 --> 00:09:55,296
they had a lying on the patterns that it wasn't in the corner of the tower

129
00:09:55,552 --> 00:09:59,168
which would be the most economic way to pass it perhaps they were thinking about the

130
00:09:59,231 --> 00:10:02,848
nap I'm not sure but I just found that I'm through the off a bit because

131
00:10:03,072 --> 00:10:07,072
they could adjust put a little right angle was fine in there just to clarify that

132
00:10:07,135 --> 00:10:07,840
it definitely was

133
00:10:09,504 --> 00:10:15,359
you know ninety degree angle between those two lengths the other thing was the because you

134
00:10:15,424 --> 00:10:20,351
had to draw out circles for the eyes to for both pink women's and I think

135
00:10:20,416 --> 00:10:24,960
it said of one centimeter circle and a two and a half a centimeter circle or

136
00:10:25,023 --> 00:10:30,559
something similar like that's that and I think they could adjust of paper that it was

137
00:10:30,656 --> 00:10:36,383
a one centimeter in diameter circle because I know it probably would have made it crazily

138
00:10:36,479 --> 00:10:39,840
small if it was the circumference all that but it was just a little bit misleading

139
00:10:40,223 --> 00:10:44,031
and I think that would out what I ended up doing because I couldn't find I'm

140
00:10:44,255 --> 00:10:48,768
I can find my confess I used a one pound coin I found an old man

141
00:10:48,831 --> 00:10:52,640
point that we haven't had taken to the bank and to get one of the new

142
00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:58,463
talk cided ones and I used a two-pound point to make the bigger set of penguin

143
00:10:58,559 --> 00:11:02,624
eyes so it works out okay in the end and they were probably the right size

144
00:11:02,911 --> 00:11:07,007
I think the smaller eyes ended up being slightly bigger and the bigger eyes was likely

145
00:11:07,072 --> 00:11:11,296
Saul over there were only you know a couple of in meters in it is that

146
00:11:12,127 --> 00:11:17,088
and but yeah was really happy without ended up handsewing the bison with the bias finding

147
00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:23,487
I machine says I'm the best slide on but then I had stitched the other side

148
00:11:23,616 --> 00:11:28,159
over and just because I do have a vise finding foot but I find with town

149
00:11:28,223 --> 00:11:33,599
and fabric it's the times to think just it just does incorporates that works so I

150
00:11:33,695 --> 00:11:37,247
just thought it would have a nice to finish anyway by hands to show on that

151
00:11:37,408 --> 00:11:42,015
okay so and that's it for now also oversee I'm if you are looking for only

152
00:11:42,176 --> 00:11:46,208
six are interesting fastens to make for a baby or toppler these are some and I

153
00:11:46,271 --> 00:11:51,776
probably recommend all of them to be honest they will fairly straightforward and there are some

154
00:11:51,903 --> 00:11:57,536
good such basters there and yeah I really enjoyed making more actually and the other been

155
00:11:57,888 --> 00:12:01,312
posted off and ready to be given as give thanks for watching
