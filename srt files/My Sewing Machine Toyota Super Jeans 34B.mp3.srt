00:00:00,544 --> 00:00:04,159
today I'm going to do a review of my sewing machine as a way that you

1
00:00:04,223 --> 00:00:07,423
like this video and flight see more please I forget to like unsubscribe if you haven't

2
00:00:07,487 --> 00:00:12,223
already the main sewing wishing and I use is the Toyota supervenes thirsty for which is

3
00:00:12,319 --> 00:00:16,895
hip on my serving table they tell you to do three different super jeans models or

4
00:00:16,992 --> 00:00:20,511
other their two main models and then there's a different

5
00:00:22,048 --> 00:00:28,351
option for one of the models as the soup teams fifteen which is a slightly more

6
00:00:28,416 --> 00:00:33,984
basic model than this one you can I think it's a J seventeen essentially it's the

7
00:00:34,015 --> 00:00:40,352
Sufyan fifteen model but the extension table from a standard and this model the safety in

8
00:00:40,383 --> 00:00:45,824
spectacle is the one that has a few more features its other common an extension table

9
00:00:45,888 --> 00:00:49,791
but obviously you can buy it separately which I have done so the thirty-four refers to

10
00:00:49,919 --> 00:00:53,759
how many different stitches that does and which you can see on the side over here

11
00:00:53,984 --> 00:01:00,063
so the Sifton fifteen has less stitches that how to steen variations a few other differences

12
00:01:00,159 --> 00:01:04,384
with it is that you can change the press'd pit pressure so there's a dying off

13
00:01:04,480 --> 00:01:07,391
at the top there another thing that during me to this model rather than the other

14
00:01:07,456 --> 00:01:12,351
one is that you can change the stitch length so I go be useful to do

15
00:01:12,639 --> 00:01:19,648
a phone machine review of this particular machine because I'm Toyota isn't as renowned as other

16
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:22,431
makes such as generally hosannah

17
00:01:23,744 --> 00:01:29,440
half dukey honor and there are all sorts and I guess like the Leo generally are

18
00:01:29,536 --> 00:01:30,655
ones that makes commonly

19
00:01:31,807 --> 00:01:36,480
I'm sort of in the sewing community in the UK anyway it's quite easy to get

20
00:01:36,671 --> 00:01:39,328
a toy use a sewing machine as a regular

21
00:01:40,447 --> 00:01:44,896
department store for example you could get this machine or you could get the suitings fifteen

22
00:01:44,959 --> 00:01:50,751
version anyway that someone like our loss or hobby craft one key advantage of this machine

23
00:01:50,816 --> 00:01:55,328
would be that it's pretty recently priced for what it does it's also by the name

24
00:01:55,391 --> 00:01:59,552
super jeans it is a heavy duty machine which means that it can get through some

25
00:01:59,744 --> 00:02:03,903
very sick materials they claim before the sleeper dooms machines is that it can get through

26
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:07,776
I think it's up to twelve layers of denim I'm not sure I've actually tried this

27
00:02:07,935 --> 00:02:09,727
possibly my clear plentiful

28
00:02:10,751 --> 00:02:12,576
may have had several ways

29
00:02:13,983 --> 00:02:18,559
but I'm not even sure then I got quite to that caliber restes old anyway it

30
00:02:18,591 --> 00:02:23,679
has managed to do everything I've asked that to do and I have done a range

31
00:02:23,776 --> 00:02:30,432
of projects from doing simple free machine embroidery to doing much more up host rebased projects

32
00:02:30,656 --> 00:02:36,511
or like the clear using different thick layers of denim but also have used final fabrics

33
00:02:36,735 --> 00:02:41,535
and it does cope with us as well so it's hard to compare with I'm some

34
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:47,744
of the bigger brandings and then some machine worlds I have east mother and bottles probably

35
00:02:47,807 --> 00:02:53,664
been leading me actually so my man's of machine which my mom currently has is a

36
00:02:53,759 --> 00:02:58,848
generally new home and it is lovely to work with that is when it's working so

37
00:02:59,039 --> 00:03:01,856
you do have to maintain it quite a lot you have to make to you oil

38
00:03:01,919 --> 00:03:07,007
it rapidly and clean as ontically but saying that when you have maintained it beautifully it

39
00:03:07,104 --> 00:03:14,591
stitches lovely it's pretty quiet to be honest and we have just stitches lovely I've been

40
00:03:14,656 --> 00:03:20,384
to like about education courses locally and they have generally machines as well which mechanical ones

41
00:03:20,447 --> 00:03:25,216
like this machine and again they're pretty substantial it's a bit hard to say with the

42
00:03:25,279 --> 00:03:28,479
ones that you use that because obviously lots of people

43
00:03:29,535 --> 00:03:34,559
use the machines so I think they do that about more worn out than your machine

44
00:03:34,623 --> 00:03:38,848
at home went away the only one prudently using it I will certainly do just get

45
00:03:38,944 --> 00:03:43,167
familiar with your ring machine because you use that one the most out of any sewing

46
00:03:43,231 --> 00:03:49,087
machine it does mean that you do get a preference towards it so although I have

47
00:03:49,184 --> 00:03:53,024
no problem with the machines or use that class I do prefer using my own so

48
00:03:53,184 --> 00:03:57,503
machine just because I'm very used to it so another key feature for this machine is

49
00:03:57,567 --> 00:03:59,231
that it comes with a glide effort which

50
00:04:04,735 --> 00:04:10,272
this line of it is part of the selling point for the sections model and I

51
00:04:10,399 --> 00:04:14,175
presume how it's supposed to get through upswell layers of denim but to be honest I

52
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:15,039
hadn't really used that

53
00:04:16,096 --> 00:04:18,783
much at all I think I've had it on the old time but I had to

54
00:04:18,847 --> 00:04:24,096
find it's really hard to use because it's a solid metal fit you can't really see

55
00:04:24,191 --> 00:04:28,160
where you're going with it and it's a bit bigger than a regular fit

56
00:04:29,696 --> 00:04:34,303
I go like this anyway so I find it really clunky to use so haven't actually

57
00:04:34,368 --> 00:04:38,752
used it but other mentions just use in the regular for all using a walking fit

58
00:04:39,007 --> 00:04:43,167
I find it perfectly find to use but the projects I've done so far so moving

59
00:04:43,231 --> 00:04:47,712
on to why I like this model so firstly it gets through an awful lot as

60
00:04:47,776 --> 00:04:53,567
I mentioned I've made different up post realisms I made some unburies with this machine I

61
00:04:54,175 --> 00:05:01,855
need much thicker garment such as that to know benefit upcycled from to pass of denim

62
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:07,328
jeans I've done an awful of free machine embroidery and that is something I do like

63
00:05:07,455 --> 00:05:12,415
that you can drop the dog teeth on it so that's a very useful feature if

64
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:18,015
you do some free machine embroidery because although you can get the models and my other

65
00:05:18,111 --> 00:05:23,391
sewing machine which is so rettore you've set but it's a bit more basic you put

66
00:05:23,808 --> 00:05:27,839
on in place over the top but it does mean that you been elevated your work

67
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:32,799
and I find that sometimes that doesn't work very well I mentioned that Toyota is more

68
00:05:32,864 --> 00:05:37,376
of a budget machine series so it does mean that if you do need to be

69
00:05:37,471 --> 00:05:44,640
additional feet there normally cheaper than other brandings obviously it it can vary but I find

70
00:05:44,704 --> 00:05:50,463
that you can get the machine feet for this model and a pretty good price it's

71
00:05:50,592 --> 00:05:54,144
just a little extra pulse I like but I do really like that it's got a

72
00:05:54,272 --> 00:06:00,000
giant backstitch sleeper and it's very easy to use it has a good range of stitches

73
00:06:00,191 --> 00:06:05,791
and boast stretch and for wave and fabric or just decorative there is an inbuilt threader

74
00:06:06,847 --> 00:06:11,104
the head which I don't use an awful lot but it does come in use if

75
00:06:11,167 --> 00:06:14,976
you're really struggling to threat the machine the machine itself oiling so you don't need to

76
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:18,399
worry about making do you oil at every so often I would take quite like that

77
00:06:18,463 --> 00:06:23,167
it is a manual mechanical machine rather than a computer rights one I don't know why

78
00:06:23,295 --> 00:06:27,264
I just don't like I've got a little more control labor it it also means that

79
00:06:27,903 --> 00:06:32,671
it doesn't reset when you switch out on enough I know some computer models probably do

80
00:06:32,832 --> 00:06:38,623
remember what last stitch you were using but obviously on this unless you change it it

81
00:06:39,007 --> 00:06:43,040
stays to the last nothing you had that can be a downside as well because if

82
00:06:43,104 --> 00:06:49,216
you say for example I was doing my hundred day project so I was doing three

83
00:06:49,279 --> 00:06:54,079
machine broidery and then I decided to say something else I'm did a regular sewing project

84
00:06:54,144 --> 00:06:59,615
I accidentally left this stitch length on zero or very close to zero and couldn't understand

85
00:06:59,679 --> 00:07:03,552
why the fabric was of beating through the machine even though it put the dog to

86
00:07:03,648 --> 00:07:07,776
that was overly could look at the stitch length that such a short like that it

87
00:07:07,967 --> 00:07:13,312
just was a really so the drawbacks for this machine personally for me is that you

88
00:07:13,407 --> 00:07:17,791
can't change the stitch with so it's great that you can change the lengths which you

89
00:07:17,855 --> 00:07:22,976
do with this great I go here which is not available Suakin fifteen it's a feature

90
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:27,231
that some of thirty for however you can't change the switch with which you can on

91
00:07:27,328 --> 00:07:31,967
other machines and other drawbacks for this machine which is quite a big one really is

92
00:07:32,032 --> 00:07:36,575
that it's really loud so perhaps I'll add a clip on how loud is because a

93
00:07:36,671 --> 00:07:41,376
lot of the videos I do I ever cut out the sound of the machine or

94
00:07:41,791 --> 00:07:47,903
it it's time-lapsed anyway so I've got rid of the sound anyway but it is immensely

95
00:07:47,967 --> 00:07:52,160
loud and a lot of the time I do with noise-canceling headphones with it if I

96
00:07:52,256 --> 00:07:56,768
won't do listen something else while I'm working this isn't always the drawback by guess if

97
00:07:56,832 --> 00:08:00,959
you live and share the commination that might be a problem so if you just don't

98
00:08:01,055 --> 00:08:05,216
like the noise so it probably has trying but we buy if you are concerned about

99
00:08:05,247 --> 00:08:10,656
the noise level it it's quite loud another issue is that because it's light weight or

100
00:08:10,847 --> 00:08:15,903
fairly lightweight for a sewing machine it does mean that it can start dancing if you're

101
00:08:16,256 --> 00:08:22,303
during a heavy duty midst of so so sometimes I feel like I'm almost dancing with

102
00:08:22,335 --> 00:08:25,984
the machine I think you do get used to it so as I said before you

103
00:08:26,048 --> 00:08:30,880
get used to using your machine but it testily that it does feel like you're moving

104
00:08:30,911 --> 00:08:37,184
with the machine at that point it's something that I think my lands old generally wouldn't

105
00:08:37,247 --> 00:08:42,495
do because it is really heavy and it's quite her to move around but once it's

106
00:08:42,559 --> 00:08:46,624
sat down where you want to it doesn't really move it's a bit more reassuring in

107
00:08:46,656 --> 00:08:50,624
that sense because it doesn't feel like you're going to be wrong because it's dancing on

108
00:08:50,687 --> 00:08:55,200
the table so yeah it's quite bouncy it's so does the heavy duty work but I

109
00:08:55,296 --> 00:08:59,392
think that's the main drawback of it being so that the heavy duty machine when it's

110
00:08:59,711 --> 00:09:02,911
such a lightweight one as well because it kind of needs a bit of weight to

111
00:09:02,976 --> 00:09:08,383
stop it dancing around the next row back it's kind of just a personal note and

112
00:09:08,447 --> 00:09:11,903
it's probably when you can result by just buying any both but it don't have an

113
00:09:12,096 --> 00:09:15,903
old light bulb in it so it's kind of got a sort of yellow orange glow

114
00:09:16,159 --> 00:09:22,304
whereas probably people know a model you to get an led light visit in the I

115
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:26,463
will say how to run before the first spoke I had in here he kept them

116
00:09:26,591 --> 00:09:31,231
unscrewing I think because I was doing some heavy duty work it just kept it kept

117
00:09:31,359 --> 00:09:35,072
listening when the ball was and it will mayst came out a couple of times I

118
00:09:35,168 --> 00:09:38,239
felt like I have replaced it now and actually this once said I'm fine so maybe

119
00:09:38,304 --> 00:09:42,783
the first hope was out of heaven issue so again you can only get a replacement

120
00:09:42,848 --> 00:09:47,263
mbd both but as far as I'm aware because I've got this machine about five years

121
00:09:47,328 --> 00:09:51,840
ago so I'm not sure if newer versions of it comes with an eddy bulb that

122
00:09:52,768 --> 00:09:57,695
this one obviously did and similarly another drawback might be I'm not too fast with this

123
00:09:57,791 --> 00:10:00,416
but it might be in a sheaf of someone else is that the fact it is

124
00:10:00,479 --> 00:10:06,559
black it might be a bit problematic with lysing issues because I guess the kind of

125
00:10:06,624 --> 00:10:12,895
absorbs the light rather than helping light bounce on to your work but I'm not really

126
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:15,776
sure how much of an issue that would be if someone is ever really been an

127
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:19,520
issue for me I already mentioned the glider fence which can be a bit of an

128
00:10:19,583 --> 00:10:23,168
issue because it's so big that I haven't really used that and finally I wanted to

129
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:26,559
point out that it is a forset button-holes so if you do prepare one set button-hole

130
00:10:27,168 --> 00:10:32,000
that would be something to consider before purchasing this machine so my verdict is that I

131
00:10:32,159 --> 00:10:38,815
would recommend this machine particularly if you're on a tight budget and you need something that

132
00:10:39,392 --> 00:10:44,447
is step up from the entry level sewing machines because it does have those extra features

133
00:10:44,575 --> 00:10:49,408
that does mean you can get it through a much wider range of projects then you

134
00:10:49,504 --> 00:10:53,536
can from a basic sewing machine it is a substantial machine and it hasn't let me

135
00:10:53,599 --> 00:10:57,184
down currently it is a good model and it does have all these great features but

136
00:10:57,216 --> 00:11:01,632
obviously daily to be aware of those potential drawbacks if they could affect you that's it

137
00:11:01,664 --> 00:11:02,976
for this time thanks for watching
