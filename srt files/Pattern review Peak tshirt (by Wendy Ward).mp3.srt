00:00:00,639 --> 00:00:04,736
today I'm repairing the pink t-shirt by Wendy would if you hurt this video and time

1
00:00:04,768 --> 00:00:08,895
and already please don't forget to light and subscribe so here is my finished peak t-shirt

2
00:00:09,119 --> 00:00:15,776
it is in Wendy wards book about net fabric items which is a beginner's guide to

3
00:00:15,871 --> 00:00:21,728
sewing with knitted fabrics so the variation I made was the plane t-shirt and I actually

4
00:00:22,368 --> 00:00:22,719
did

5
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:28,479
Lincoln between the short and the long version not intentionally I just got really confused with

6
00:00:28,544 --> 00:00:35,167
the lines to tricks and didn't realize that I traced the short length but actually ended

7
00:00:35,231 --> 00:00:38,687
up adding five cents a piece of anyway so it is longer than the prop length

8
00:00:38,911 --> 00:00:44,127
but it's not out long and the longing so I think the long ride from me

9
00:00:44,223 --> 00:00:45,568
go a little with further down

10
00:00:46,751 --> 00:00:53,312
I made the second slice from the left the actual bust measurement between thirty foreign three

11
00:00:53,408 --> 00:00:57,408
course an inch to thirty six and a quarter of an inch or eighty-eight ninety two

12
00:00:57,504 --> 00:01:02,240
centimeters so it's worth noting that I am at the top end of that measurement so

13
00:01:02,431 --> 00:01:07,360
the fabric I've used I have used a remnant fabric which was in my stash I

14
00:01:07,456 --> 00:01:11,839
bought it as a remnant after fabric shop I feel like it may have been the

15
00:01:11,935 --> 00:01:17,375
fabric show in to button and Devon it's called movers I think anyway I think it's

16
00:01:17,695 --> 00:01:21,888
a palm to room a fabric or Stephanie quite thick them if I have to tell

17
00:01:22,239 --> 00:01:26,400
I'm which side is which it looks pretty much the same of both sides and it's

18
00:01:27,167 --> 00:01:30,879
quite thick fur in it so and it was very stable to work with if you

19
00:01:30,944 --> 00:01:34,431
did see my video last week you will see me construct in this top and a

20
00:01:34,527 --> 00:01:40,127
glimpse of the final result and because I added this toucan embellishment making the two can

21
00:01:40,223 --> 00:01:44,319
teach it is all my make known for twenty twenty it was that might make from

22
00:01:44,416 --> 00:01:48,543
twenty nineteen but he didn't get round to it and essentially I got this out from

23
00:01:49,248 --> 00:01:53,344
a cheap through the see that I got all over and only wore one it's just

24
00:01:53,375 --> 00:01:57,055
because I thought it might make a nice embellishment and I'm pretty people the results but

25
00:01:57,087 --> 00:02:01,632
argosy if you want to see how I added that to this teacher pattern you can

26
00:02:01,919 --> 00:02:06,304
guarantee last week vidian in terms of difficulty this was a nice beginners makes though I

27
00:02:06,367 --> 00:02:11,744
did that protects a difficult this was a shirt which was very complicated in the technical

28
00:02:11,807 --> 00:02:16,735
whereas this one felt a lot easier obviously it is with the net fabric so you

29
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:22,016
have to be especially careful and it's very easy to stretch out in fabric Wendy ward

30
00:02:22,111 --> 00:02:26,912
does guide you about how to use Nitz appropriately and gives you some nice tips and

31
00:02:26,975 --> 00:02:31,199
tricks along the way so although it is made in a net fabric and that brings

32
00:02:31,264 --> 00:02:36,544
its own challenges it's only a thing or two three four by pattern pieces the hardest

33
00:02:36,576 --> 00:02:40,927
part is probably adding the neckbands and because even with the sleeves there a lot easier

34
00:02:40,992 --> 00:02:45,983
to attach in my own opinion then I'm with boys and fabric in terms of clarity

35
00:02:46,143 --> 00:02:51,007
I found Wendy was instructions were nice and clear she's got lovely illustrations and to demonstrate

36
00:02:51,167 --> 00:02:55,136
every point it's whites noting that I did just make the basic teacher so there are

37
00:02:55,199 --> 00:02:59,904
other variations where you can use remnants of a brick you need to add some little

38
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:04,927
patches onto the front of your talk so I don't know how clear that is from

39
00:03:04,992 --> 00:03:08,703
a glance they look fine but obviously you might want to check that out and still

40
00:03:08,735 --> 00:03:14,944
the most confusing part to me although it probably is making my fault was tracing out

41
00:03:15,104 --> 00:03:18,815
because I did slip up on that all of the patterns or colocated on the sheets

42
00:03:18,912 --> 00:03:23,072
but some spill over to another sheet so you you have to trace a part of

43
00:03:23,199 --> 00:03:26,591
the past in peace and then you have to find the other section of it line

44
00:03:26,688 --> 00:03:30,656
up and then trace the other half of it so it's not the easiest one to

45
00:03:31,423 --> 00:03:35,807
set yourself up for you do need to add that bit of time and really concentrate

46
00:03:36,447 --> 00:03:41,632
when you do create your passive pieces at the beginning which obviously I slipped up one

47
00:03:41,888 --> 00:03:45,888
by cutting the room side to the design and fit as you see it it's quite

48
00:03:46,048 --> 00:03:51,167
a least fit t-shirts I mentioned earlier that I'm at the top range of the bus

49
00:03:51,264 --> 00:03:55,679
measurement for the size I made I think if it's really well actually on my shoulders

50
00:03:56,223 --> 00:04:00,128
so I'm really happy with that I'm not sure if I've been at the lower end

51
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:05,119
of the sighting whether that I would have found this a bit too baggy but actually

52
00:04:05,216 --> 00:04:11,231
this this amount of Luke's fittedness is painfully anyway to like I really like wearing at

53
00:04:11,264 --> 00:04:14,912
least for its anyway honestly if you're not a fan of least for items it might

54
00:04:14,944 --> 00:04:18,368
not be the person for you but saying that if you don't wear clothes like this

55
00:04:18,528 --> 00:04:22,463
out and about it would make a lovely pajama top which I'm very tempted to do

56
00:04:22,656 --> 00:04:27,264
I didn't actually realize how high up the neckline was and but yeah I'm really surprised

57
00:04:27,295 --> 00:04:32,063
actually a consensus of my collarbone I think and starts another thing to my mind know

58
00:04:32,127 --> 00:04:36,959
a lot of people don't like a I'm the neckline has as high as this obversely

59
00:04:37,055 --> 00:04:40,928
you might be able to cut it down if you like I know there's another person

60
00:04:40,992 --> 00:04:44,320
in the book which is for a tank top you might be able to use the

61
00:04:44,384 --> 00:04:48,447
neckline and that I'm not sure the time taken this is a nice quick satisfy makes

62
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:53,279
so I think it probably only took me and our two hours talks to cut it

63
00:04:53,791 --> 00:04:57,696
obviously tracing it was a whole other matter again didn't take actually that long is just

64
00:04:57,760 --> 00:05:01,760
obviously and that's not the longest part for me was obviously adding this toucan embellishment just

65
00:05:01,791 --> 00:05:05,152
because I was I'm quite sure what I was doing because it was an immigrant mattering

66
00:05:05,183 --> 00:05:09,631
me however the actual pattern was really quick I made practically all of it in one

67
00:05:09,824 --> 00:05:13,600
evening after work and then I left it a day to hang which I'm really glad

68
00:05:13,664 --> 00:05:17,152
I did because I did have to adjust the handle that so I did leave Heming

69
00:05:17,567 --> 00:05:21,312
to another night so basically I did in three sitting technically you could have done it

70
00:05:21,343 --> 00:05:25,407
in half the day but I would recommend leaving your covering to had just in case

71
00:05:25,503 --> 00:05:29,727
it it don't drop of it so I roll I would recommend this pattern I think

72
00:05:29,791 --> 00:05:33,824
it's a really nice basic teach out which is essentially a hook point of it she

73
00:05:33,888 --> 00:05:38,656
didn't have some different hacks and variations in the bucket well if you wanted to just

74
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:41,343
it up a bit or make it into a draft I just think it's a really

75
00:05:41,407 --> 00:05:45,791
nice quick sissified make and yeah I think it was making a meeting phenomenal I do

76
00:05:45,824 --> 00:05:50,783
you think it's nice to you in fellowship if you have gotten fabric like mine or

77
00:05:51,007 --> 00:05:55,264
other way to use a nice patterned fabric or do the patchwork design that she suggested

78
00:05:55,328 --> 00:05:58,175
in the book I think that would just them give it a bit more interest I

79
00:05:58,272 --> 00:06:00,223
came that's it for this week thanks for watching
