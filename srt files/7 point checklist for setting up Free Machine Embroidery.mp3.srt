00:00:00,159 --> 00:00:04,191
hello today I'm going to go through my seven quaint checklist the setting up for through

1
00:00:04,320 --> 00:00:09,600
machine embroidery so you might notice from some of my previous videos that I do a

2
00:00:09,696 --> 00:00:13,600
feather of free machine and murderee I have an ocean done a lot recently which is

3
00:00:13,663 --> 00:00:18,208
why I've set up this southern quite checklist because last time I used that I forgot

4
00:00:18,239 --> 00:00:22,687
to lower the dog feet it's good to have a checklist for setting up for the

5
00:00:22,784 --> 00:00:27,871
machine embroidery just because you can make sure that your sewing machine is set up on

6
00:00:27,936 --> 00:00:33,535
the best configuration afrits on my son machine there's a few different adjustments you need to

7
00:00:33,599 --> 00:00:37,504
make compared to regular sirring it's also good as well actually at the end of room

8
00:00:37,535 --> 00:00:42,816
machine embroidery to make sure you reverse these steps because there's been plenty of times where

9
00:00:42,880 --> 00:00:48,992
of letter of Rui Xingu embroidery wondered why say that dog the aren't moving the fabric

10
00:00:49,055 --> 00:00:55,680
forward I've also had the issue where I've left the tension loose on the other bread

11
00:00:55,967 --> 00:01:01,535
and it meant like that to redo seems so the first one on my list is

12
00:01:01,599 --> 00:01:06,688
to make sure that you lowered the dog feet or depending on your machine you've put

13
00:01:06,816 --> 00:01:12,255
the darning place on their so when you do regular machine sewing you've got the dog

14
00:01:12,351 --> 00:01:17,823
feet at the bottom of your machine and needs help to feed through the fabric and

15
00:01:17,856 --> 00:01:24,000
so that it moves along and you only just the seed of that through the press

16
00:01:24,096 --> 00:01:28,704
of it or you might you the Boston depending on your machine there with my machine

17
00:01:28,928 --> 00:01:34,944
I've got to switch at the fact which lowers the deputy about other machines you have

18
00:01:35,071 --> 00:01:39,552
a zoning plate which can cover up the dog tea so that they weren't into bear

19
00:01:39,615 --> 00:01:43,199
and they won't remove your fabric for you so one of the great things about through

20
00:01:43,295 --> 00:01:48,704
machine and raw Dariusz that's you get to move your fabric in all different directions not

21
00:01:48,767 --> 00:01:53,727
just forward through the machine and lowering the dog to call covering them is the first

22
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:57,888
step to ensuring that you have that freedom of movement the second point in my tennis

23
00:01:58,080 --> 00:02:02,879
is to change the press office so on a regular sewing machine that you will have

24
00:02:03,583 --> 00:02:03,648
the

25
00:02:04,704 --> 00:02:10,080
regular peh sophont and so on this one it's the one that's on the machine to

26
00:02:10,175 --> 00:02:14,048
start with it means you can do both zigzag and you can

27
00:02:15,167 --> 00:02:20,576
also do straight stitch you could do all the I'm machine stitches on their however with

28
00:02:20,671 --> 00:02:25,343
an embroidery puts it looks slightly different it means that it's just a bit easier for

29
00:02:25,376 --> 00:02:30,304
you to move around in all those different directions as I mentioned before make starting fits

30
00:02:30,751 --> 00:02:35,776
of designed so that you can still use this exact function or a white stitch as

31
00:02:35,839 --> 00:02:41,279
well as a straight stitch but it just means that it's normally got offering around it

32
00:02:41,567 --> 00:02:45,408
I guess that holds the fabric in place I'm and yet just means that you can

33
00:02:45,503 --> 00:02:50,432
go in any direction there are some people who do three machine and broidery without a

34
00:02:50,496 --> 00:02:55,455
bombing fits and which obviously is an option I think you've got to be of it

35
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:59,936
all careful with how fast you need your fabric though because you are at risk of

36
00:02:59,968 --> 00:03:05,119
sending or breaking the needle because you don't have that extra guards and also just a

37
00:03:05,216 --> 00:03:09,376
health and city point is that you can stand runover your fingers as well I guess

38
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:13,824
the press of it helps keep your fingers at a distance point number three is to

39
00:03:13,919 --> 00:03:18,656
check which machine needle you are using so sometimes I don't bother with this step if

40
00:03:18,751 --> 00:03:23,871
I if I'm doing through she embroidery on away the piece of at broke I've just

41
00:03:23,904 --> 00:03:30,272
so got something in a woven fabric previously it's a roughly similar fabric weight or just

42
00:03:30,335 --> 00:03:36,063
leaves so what I currently got on that I'm but you can get embroidery needles as

43
00:03:36,128 --> 00:03:40,768
well which I think there is it easier to threat I did it got a slightly

44
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:45,311
wider point and a white a hole in the needle so it is easy especially few

45
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:51,423
using fancier threats it just means that it will help you threat your machine it will

46
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:55,488
help to make sure that you're using the right so machine needle if you do end

47
00:03:55,520 --> 00:04:01,216
up using the wrong one and it can obviously cause issues that can you know it

48
00:04:01,248 --> 00:04:06,304
can affect the how how it's stitching you can affect how it's going through the fabric

49
00:04:06,464 --> 00:04:10,783
whether creating larger holes or not so it really is worth making sure that you are

50
00:04:10,848 --> 00:04:14,623
you from the right machine needle because then it will stop at it could prevent you

51
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:19,679
have in to resolve issues further down the line quite number for it is to choose

52
00:04:19,808 --> 00:04:25,920
your are preterit and your bobbin so sometimes I don't want to changing the bobbin it

53
00:04:25,951 --> 00:04:30,111
can be a bit for fast and sometimes I do change it it kind of depends

54
00:04:30,175 --> 00:04:35,776
on the project depends on what I'm making who it's for will say whether it's going

55
00:04:35,839 --> 00:04:40,384
to show up so sometimes you might want the Bob in to match the backload fabric

56
00:04:40,447 --> 00:04:44,511
anyway if you know people can see that that sometimes you will want it to match

57
00:04:44,608 --> 00:04:49,567
the other thread just because in case the tension berries as you stitch it might appear

58
00:04:49,664 --> 00:04:54,272
on on the top of the fabric and then in which case you know might detract

59
00:04:54,335 --> 00:04:58,783
if you've got a really bad the contrasting thread on the bottom you're gonna see flecks

60
00:04:58,847 --> 00:05:02,592
of that on the top but sometimes you might want that effect so you know you

61
00:05:02,687 --> 00:05:07,359
might purpose to the Jews of a nice contrasting thread on the bottom in the bobbin

62
00:05:07,712 --> 00:05:13,567
so that you then can have that extra interesting detail on the top point number five

63
00:05:13,824 --> 00:05:20,511
is to adjust the upper for attention I know some people do also adjust the Bob

64
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:25,343
intention and in the past of on a different machine I've had issue where I've been

65
00:05:25,984 --> 00:05:31,167
broken the Bob in case so normally I try to shy away from adjusting of in

66
00:05:31,264 --> 00:05:35,071
case I'm not sure how easy as to do on this machine anyway because it's a

67
00:05:35,584 --> 00:05:39,264
one where you drop the bubbling from the top rather than so on my machine depending

68
00:05:39,391 --> 00:05:45,183
on the fabrics of threads and just generally the project I'm doing I will tend to

69
00:05:45,312 --> 00:05:50,559
adjust the tension to about minus two this will very

70
00:05:52,063 --> 00:05:57,152
different machine is vary depending on like I say what you're doing what I assume machine

71
00:05:57,216 --> 00:05:59,872
you've got that even you using whether you're using

72
00:06:01,279 --> 00:06:06,623
a spit of big darning birds and you know how you're preparing your fabric which will

73
00:06:06,847 --> 00:06:12,447
get on to shortly if you don't want your lower thread showing it's good to lower

74
00:06:12,511 --> 00:06:17,376
the number lower attention on your so on some machine so mine itself of the point

75
00:06:17,536 --> 00:06:21,567
so their correct tension there's an arrow the where it would be humbly so I put

76
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:25,951
it to minus two so if you your machine is normally sat on safe for because

77
00:06:25,984 --> 00:06:31,135
sundial got on the number so then you adjust it to perhaps the real you know

78
00:06:31,295 --> 00:06:35,104
to and up and see whether that works so is always worth testing that out that

79
00:06:35,615 --> 00:06:39,391
that's something I tend to forget about argosy again if you do on that effect of

80
00:06:39,488 --> 00:06:42,687
the dread coming up you might wanna see what it's just like on a normal tension

81
00:06:42,847 --> 00:06:46,656
or you might want to actually increase it to plus one or two and the data

82
00:06:46,687 --> 00:06:50,752
be here for could sometimes of you put it to high the treddle separate number six

83
00:06:50,816 --> 00:06:55,200
is to choose your stitch and stitch length with free machine embroidery you're not going to

84
00:06:55,231 --> 00:06:59,679
get the same effect with your decorative stitches some of them will just look like exact

85
00:06:59,743 --> 00:07:06,144
stitches depending on how you feed the fabric through the machine because the machines

86
00:07:07,455 --> 00:07:14,272
normally programmed to speed through to create the particular design because you're taking that element away

87
00:07:14,432 --> 00:07:19,104
by having the dog tea clothes or covered you're going to affect how that decorated it

88
00:07:19,167 --> 00:07:22,880
comes out saying that you can get a lot of good effects from it a lot

89
00:07:22,911 --> 00:07:27,167
of the pre machine broidery I do is just the plains through stitch so I'll make

90
00:07:27,231 --> 00:07:29,343
sure on my machine that I changed it to

91
00:07:30,623 --> 00:07:35,328
number six on my machine which is the straight stitch where the machine is in the

92
00:07:35,391 --> 00:07:43,776
middle of the darning but I also normally reduce it to a lower stitch length so

93
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:48,256
on this machine I've got the freedom to adjust it to hold on I want the

94
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:53,407
stitch length which is one of the reasons I decided I'm that this would be good

95
00:07:53,791 --> 00:07:58,816
sewing machine to use so at the moment I've got mine to zero point five which

96
00:07:59,231 --> 00:08:02,208
is a valued like you could fill all the way down to zero because at the

97
00:08:02,272 --> 00:08:07,040
end of the day you're affecting how long the stitches are well though I guess that

98
00:08:07,104 --> 00:08:12,415
again could affect how much you see of the lama thread the bobbin coming up onto

99
00:08:12,832 --> 00:08:17,312
the surface of your fabric if you do have a machine which has preset stitch lengths

100
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:22,880
that's not the problem either I have also used I'm my other sewing machine which is

101
00:08:23,167 --> 00:08:28,351
also returning to but it's what set stitch lengths I won't addressed it like this one

102
00:08:28,575 --> 00:08:32,000
and I used to just have it on I think it was the smallest stitch length

103
00:08:32,096 --> 00:08:35,455
I used to put it on but it's still went fine you've just got to adjust

104
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:41,312
how quickly you move your fabric over at all you know how how fast you I'm

105
00:08:41,536 --> 00:08:46,080
not your foot down on the pedal and finally quite number seven is to prepare your

106
00:08:46,176 --> 00:08:51,392
fabric so there's a few different things you can do or rather a couple that I

107
00:08:51,520 --> 00:08:55,648
use anyway the name way that I do three machine of broidery is to use an

108
00:08:55,679 --> 00:08:58,528
embroidery who so but one here

109
00:08:59,648 --> 00:09:04,159
so all users you can see work it's great that on them it's great it to

110
00:09:04,192 --> 00:09:09,184
get under the building but they sometimes depending on how thick your broidery who is and

111
00:09:09,247 --> 00:09:14,976
especially if you're using it donning and darning plates rather than dropping the doxie it can

112
00:09:15,039 --> 00:09:20,575
be quite challenging to put an embroidery hoop underneath a machine however it is really good

113
00:09:20,736 --> 00:09:24,960
because you can get the fabric really sort with an embroidery hoop which is great because

114
00:09:25,471 --> 00:09:30,047
it means that you're going to have less issues with the machine needle going in and

115
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:33,728
out of the fabric one of the drawback is that you will if you're doing a

116
00:09:33,823 --> 00:09:37,312
larger designers you will have to keep moving the who and obviously you will need to

117
00:09:37,343 --> 00:09:42,239
press it after because it will leave a mark on your fabric and that yeah it's

118
00:09:42,271 --> 00:09:47,744
probably so my favorite method of doing through machine broidery saying that there is so if

119
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:52,416
I can scrape it under the and the darling but I will do that another option

120
00:09:52,607 --> 00:09:57,888
is to use as stabilizing fabric underneath I think the brand name of the most common

121
00:09:58,463 --> 00:10:03,744
like disposable for you can use a stitch in ten sometimes I'll use this actually just

122
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:03,935
to

123
00:10:05,056 --> 00:10:09,664
design on top of the fabric if I'm following as something I've drawn out I'll put

124
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:14,687
it on top of my fabric instead of alone and then I can see have what

125
00:10:14,752 --> 00:10:19,168
I'm stitching especially the bone a doctor fabric and I can't necessarily the fabric and in

126
00:10:19,231 --> 00:10:25,408
Canada use and a thickish stabilizing proper on the boss on the bottom of it just

127
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:31,072
to help keep it stretched out it doesn't work quite the same as an embroidery necessarily

128
00:10:31,296 --> 00:10:36,192
but it is another option especially if you are struggling getting where your use only the

129
00:10:36,288 --> 00:10:40,703
dawning puts another option depending on the weight of your fabric is to use nothing so

130
00:10:40,927 --> 00:10:46,624
especially for something like denim or really heavy canvas you don't actually need to necessarily put

131
00:10:46,687 --> 00:10:47,200
it into

132
00:10:48,831 --> 00:10:53,599
a murdering you could just hold it yourself and dried it through okay so that's my

133
00:10:53,728 --> 00:10:58,591
seven-point checklist for setting up the three machine and broidery and if you think prognosis anything

134
