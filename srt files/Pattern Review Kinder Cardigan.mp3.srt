00:00:06,943 --> 00:00:12,576
hello today I'm during a pattern review of the kinda cardigan by Wendy ward so you

1
00:00:12,640 --> 00:00:18,208
can buy this pattern either as a PDF of her website or like me can get

2
00:00:18,271 --> 00:00:19,743
it as part of her book

3
00:00:23,743 --> 00:00:30,431
so this is the book stirring with knitted fabrics so I got gifted this by my

4
00:00:30,527 --> 00:00:36,799
partner and and it's a really nice book I've only made the kindergarten Albert the moment

5
00:00:36,959 --> 00:00:39,551
but I hope to make some of the other patterns soon

6
00:00:41,408 --> 00:00:46,304
the size I've made is the second to smallest one so I think there's about five

7
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:50,048
different sizes and because it's early spit design

8
00:00:51,231 --> 00:00:56,319
the size ranges are quite broad and just simply because that is the least the card

9
00:00:56,383 --> 00:00:56,543
again

10
00:00:58,591 --> 00:01:02,624
but I used my measurements to work out which one to do I have that she

11
00:01:02,687 --> 00:01:07,232
made two of the kinda cardigan I made one of my nose for Christmas and so

12
00:01:07,328 --> 00:01:10,304
I don't have that one to show and but with that one I did

13
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:11,424
the

14
00:01:12,639 --> 00:01:17,375
there's a version that comes to your hip where is on this one I've made the

15
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:22,080
the long like version which I was planned to make for myself

16
00:01:23,456 --> 00:01:30,527
so with this version I infused a sort of mustard-yellow Ponti which I got from fabric

17
00:01:30,592 --> 00:01:35,935
land I did actually make this a little while ago and to be honest about the

18
00:01:36,031 --> 00:01:39,071
fabric hasn't lived up to the test of time

19
00:01:40,096 --> 00:01:45,599
and because it's got quite openly and I hadn't washed it yet and I think it's

20
00:01:45,664 --> 00:01:50,143
just you know a Braden with all the fabrics just general wear and tear on it

21
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:56,160
and so I'm quite disappointed about that and but saying that it's good to trial it

22
00:01:56,288 --> 00:01:59,776
in a cheaper fabric so obviously if I then wanted to make

23
00:02:00,863 --> 00:02:05,760
another version and I found a suitable fabric that I could do that I'm but saying

24
00:02:05,823 --> 00:02:10,304
that apart from that it's only that I can notice that up close like Marie's one

25
00:02:10,367 --> 00:02:14,527
of these machines that get us rid of the barbels as well although we see I'm

26
00:02:14,591 --> 00:02:18,496
away your removing fibers of the original fabric doing that

27
00:02:20,735 --> 00:02:27,039
so I've done the pockets which is an option something to note in the pattern is

28
00:02:27,104 --> 00:02:29,119
that if you want to make after variation

29
00:02:30,623 --> 00:02:38,080
with pockets you need to go to the end of the pattern instructions the with pockets

30
00:02:38,143 --> 00:02:43,807
version is after the instructions ceiling to go over there followed a bit for adding the

31
00:02:43,871 --> 00:02:48,160
pockets and then go back to the without pockets version to follow the rest of the

32
00:02:48,192 --> 00:02:48,832
instructions

33
00:02:49,919 --> 00:02:54,751
and I destroyed rhyolitic the both occasions I made it I almost ran to at them

34
00:02:54,815 --> 00:02:58,912
I've just got to a point where I hang on a sec I probably need to

35
00:02:59,007 --> 00:03:03,615
add the pockets by now and then I've noticed my error and gone back to write

36
00:03:03,712 --> 00:03:07,968
to buy it and I think those times I hadn't gone far enough that I had

37
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,136
to unpick it but and just something to bear in mind if you won't see the

38
00:03:11,199 --> 00:03:17,343
pockets and to be honest in the contents page it does highlight what page number to

39
00:03:17,408 --> 00:03:23,039
go for the pockets and I just obviously got carried away or I flicked through to

40
00:03:23,072 --> 00:03:27,455
the page the right on their but so the pocket better news duty to go ahead

41
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:33,216
about father in terms of difficulty it is a relatively simple make because it's the least

42
00:03:33,279 --> 00:03:38,016
with design you don't need to worry about the fits and because it is done with

43
00:03:38,304 --> 00:03:43,488
a knitted fabric I guess that is challenging it away but and you can make it

44
00:03:43,552 --> 00:03:48,671
out of a very stable knit fabric soap for example I've used a point aroma

45
00:03:51,136 --> 00:03:56,352
said the main challenge was the topstitching around the edge

46
00:03:57,600 --> 00:04:02,304
although I didn't have too much trouble whether if I just used a straight stitch and

47
00:04:02,335 --> 00:04:06,464
it does say that any instructions I was only the impression that Mike had to use

48
00:04:06,527 --> 00:04:10,623
this exact because it was a knit fabric but it's so stable and it doesn't stretch

49
00:04:10,688 --> 00:04:15,839
at all that you can just use a straight a fairly moist straight stitch

50
00:04:17,343 --> 00:04:21,440
so there are quite a few pieces to the pattern as well seagull the two sleeves

51
00:04:21,503 --> 00:04:25,664
to pockets if you decide to do the pockets and there's the

52
00:04:26,976 --> 00:04:31,007
and across the front and the neck which is into sections

53
00:04:32,768 --> 00:04:36,928
and you've got the option whether you add cups or not so I've added crafts on

54
00:04:37,312 --> 00:04:37,951
this version

55
00:04:39,007 --> 00:04:42,559
so a few pieces to play around with again because it's

56
00:04:43,648 --> 00:04:47,808
it is quite a simple design apart from that and but yeah there is a bit

57
00:04:47,872 --> 00:04:48,544
casting out to do

58
00:04:50,208 --> 00:04:54,303
with regards to the time taken I think the first one I made in a weekend

59
00:04:54,335 --> 00:04:55,936
and that's not including casting out time

60
00:04:57,023 --> 00:05:00,799
and I was having a lot of trouble with the so machine I was using sick

61
00:05:00,864 --> 00:05:03,295
as I was using my mom's zone machine which

62
00:05:05,376 --> 00:05:12,320
was mine as but it does require oiling and cleaning up every now and then because

63
00:05:12,384 --> 00:05:13,567
it is a fairly old machine

64
00:05:14,911 --> 00:05:19,455
so I did have issues with attention on that and I kept having to try and

65
00:05:19,872 --> 00:05:21,503
and rectify the issues

66
00:05:22,783 --> 00:05:26,752
also I was trying to make it within that weekend because it was for Christmas gift

67
00:05:26,783 --> 00:05:31,903
and I know wasn't coming back into the area before Christmas with this version I did

68
00:05:31,967 --> 00:05:35,424
actually make it and a much more relaxed pace over a week so

69
00:05:36,864 --> 00:05:41,696
why not to gauge how long it actually takes in primitively quicker the second time just

70
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:45,791
because I was familiar with the patterns world but the instructions are really close you've got

71
00:05:46,079 --> 00:05:48,415
lovely illustrations in the book as well

72
00:05:49,855 --> 00:05:54,015
I think if I made this person again I'd be tempted to try a drapier fabric

73
00:05:54,559 --> 00:05:58,239
and just to see how that would turn out as well I think it would have

74
00:05:58,335 --> 00:06:01,088
a different effect which would be interesting to

75
00:06:02,111 --> 00:06:02,239
see

76
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:10,592
I'm really happy with this make I really like the design I like big baggy clothes

77
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:15,552
and that a company to wear and it an easy go over a lot of garments

78
00:06:15,648 --> 00:06:19,615
I've got as you can tell I like yellow a lot so it goes with other

79
00:06:19,679 --> 00:06:26,048
stuff in my wardrobe and I loved that gigantic square pockets on here which is very

80
00:06:26,144 --> 00:06:29,631
handy seek and you know if you need to cook leap up out to the shops

81
00:06:29,727 --> 00:06:30,048
you can

82
00:06:31,135 --> 00:06:35,424
you can shops things in your pockets or shove your hands in this plenty of room

83
00:06:35,967 --> 00:06:41,152
and is that something I have noticed with some patterns the pockets or releasable and might

84
00:06:41,279 --> 00:06:45,727
be apple really big hands and there's no problem at all with this

85
00:06:47,359 --> 00:06:50,656
that's all I've really got to say all this and if you did once the a

86
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:55,743
written version I'll have a link to my blog post of the pattern review down below

87
00:06:55,839 --> 00:06:56,608
in the description

88
00:06:57,824 --> 00:06:59,295
but for now thanks for watching
