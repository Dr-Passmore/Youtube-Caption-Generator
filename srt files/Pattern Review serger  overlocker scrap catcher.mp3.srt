today I'm reviewing a free pattern on the line it's so so easy surges scrap pacha

1
00:00:07,616 --> 00:00:10,720
I think that's what it's called in it as a ways if you like this video

2
00:00:10,847 --> 00:00:14,880
and what Seymour don't forget to life into scribe okay so as I mentioned it's a

3
00:00:14,975 --> 00:00:18,271
free person in line if you want to the so so easy website which I will

4
00:00:18,304 --> 00:00:23,200
link in the description if you go on to the website you can view it on

5
00:00:23,263 --> 00:00:27,360
a blog post or you can download the PDF I believe and that you can print

6
00:00:27,455 --> 00:00:31,135
out I did print it out by ended up looking at the what vergine as well

7
00:00:31,648 --> 00:00:36,063
just because I printed out in greyscale and was quite hard to understand some of the

8
00:00:36,127 --> 00:00:42,368
photos because of that so there aren't any variations oversee it's one simple person however they

9
00:00:42,495 --> 00:00:48,223
do advise on how you could adjust this Matt so that it in case your overlocker

10
00:00:48,383 --> 00:00:53,344
is vastly different to the one that they used to face these measurements on I ended

11
00:00:53,408 --> 00:00:57,312
up following the exact measurements because I had a quick look and I thought it should

12
00:00:57,504 --> 00:01:01,248
fit so it's already worth noting as well I have made this as a gift so

13
00:01:02,144 --> 00:01:06,975
I will not be using it myself and so I can't really count on the practicalities

14
00:01:07,232 --> 00:01:11,872
of it and whether it is useful with a scrap patcher however I can unreceived review

15
00:01:12,064 --> 00:01:16,608
how the person was to make the fabric I've used it is probably a place to

16
00:01:16,639 --> 00:01:22,655
quoting cotton wait I use us to make my partner about for carrying his marking when

17
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:25,727
he used to teach and I had some of it left over and I thought we

18
00:01:25,791 --> 00:01:29,952
would be patted for this project so it's the Sudley Emmett I've got it in two

19
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:36,000
colourways so and it's this to can fabric and then you conceived a contrast fabric underneath

20
00:01:36,096 --> 00:01:36,319
them

21
00:01:37,599 --> 00:01:41,791
and it's also inside in the pockets as well for the edging of just used and

22
00:01:41,856 --> 00:01:46,400
shot ports bias finding so I think it must be just by a wide length I

23
00:01:46,463 --> 00:01:50,879
think when it's folded over it's about one point to some smiters in terms of difficulty

24
00:01:51,167 --> 00:01:57,695
I parents this person relatively challenging to be honest it's quite simple it's all squares and

25
00:01:57,760 --> 00:02:02,944
rectangles so in that respect it's quite easy but there is an awful of bias finding

26
00:02:03,232 --> 00:02:07,552
and although I don't need like to to the machine stitched the first slide and then

27
00:02:07,648 --> 00:02:12,768
hand so the second sighed I used the machine to topstitch and I just found that

28
00:02:12,832 --> 00:02:16,255
it dragged quite a bit his public as I don't do it that often I haven't

29
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:20,960
practiced enough to get a really nice finish but I did find that challenging moving once

30
00:02:21,055 --> 00:02:26,688
clarity I did find that the instructions were quite challenging to follow I I don't think

31
00:02:26,783 --> 00:02:29,535
I was in the best from the mind when I was making it to be honest

32
00:02:29,951 --> 00:02:36,768
he could just be my interpretation at the time however I did find aspects I wasn't

33
00:02:37,024 --> 00:02:38,048
sure what I was doing

34
00:02:39,072 --> 00:02:43,296
I think part of it was because you're meant to quote the pieces and I haven't

35
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:48,768
I have eased fusible place so I have got a bit of having in there but

36
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:54,048
I think what they've done in the past Amoz they had quoted the outer and lion

37
00:02:54,143 --> 00:02:54,815
pieces together

38
00:02:56,031 --> 00:02:57,888
and as I didn't do that

39
00:02:59,391 --> 00:03:03,776
I was looking at ways where I could hide the seams if that makes sense so

40
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:08,160
I kind of made it more complicated for myself than it should have been there I'm

41
00:03:08,192 --> 00:03:13,184
not really sure whether it's just I had my own agenda so I was conflicting with

42
00:03:13,279 --> 00:03:18,272
the instructions or whether it was that they were quite difficult to follow there are some

43
00:03:18,335 --> 00:03:22,432
reviews on the blog post and and they were really positive so he should just be

44
00:03:22,527 --> 00:03:26,367
able them in the right framer mind or I was so determined to hide all of

45
00:03:26,432 --> 00:03:30,399
the raw edges that I ended up doing my own thing for the design and fit

46
00:03:30,591 --> 00:03:35,679
as you can see it it's my overlocker anyway perfectly and fleet will fit the overlooker

47
00:03:35,776 --> 00:03:40,960
of the recipients as well but I think their family landed the sides of people occurring

48
00:03:41,184 --> 00:03:45,632
fingers crossed it well yeah so it fits I'm very nicely on here I've actually got

49
00:03:45,664 --> 00:03:50,175
it on the table wethers a slope on the side and which normally haven't use my

50
00:03:50,399 --> 00:03:54,848
locker on this table and so it's not sitting quite as nice to was that normally

51
00:03:54,912 --> 00:03:59,423
would so if I had it on the table which didn't have this step edge I

52
00:03:59,552 --> 00:04:04,927
would have the overlocker right up to the edge and then that would allow the excess

53
00:04:05,024 --> 00:04:09,792
fabric that was being cast of to fall nicely into the pockets I really liked the

54
00:04:09,856 --> 00:04:14,432
design I like that is very generous though if you know you don't regularly empty your

55
00:04:14,496 --> 00:04:20,447
scrap capture that's okay cause you got loads of rum they're also I guess if they

56
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:24,415
had been a bit smaller it might have known it might missed it I'm not sure

57
00:04:24,992 --> 00:04:29,183
that's yeah it works really well I'm very happy with it I am thinking that if

58
00:04:29,247 --> 00:04:35,264
I did make another one I would possibly look at lining the pockets with a

59
00:04:36,287 --> 00:04:43,295
different fabric so one that I guess it's easier to scoop the remnants out of because

60
00:04:43,872 --> 00:04:47,839
I just think that might be you know older fluffy lets you end up getting when

61
00:04:47,903 --> 00:04:52,160
you I'm overlock likely a few gossipers of them fasting awarding

62
00:04:53,407 --> 00:04:56,671
you've got the issue that you might not ever be able to completely get all the

63
00:04:56,768 --> 00:05:02,623
stuff out of the the pocket section so possibly I might do something like you know

64
00:05:02,656 --> 00:05:07,071
a bit more of a plastically fabric will and Waterbury fabric gone will to resist of

65
00:05:07,135 --> 00:05:11,712
one I'm just kiss then it'll be a locks me there or I guess you could

66
00:05:13,503 --> 00:05:18,752
use that final that stuff you can iron on to make your fabric have that so

67
00:05:18,944 --> 00:05:22,656
flaxy sheen so you could do that as well and it might be easier to scoop

68
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:26,048
out your fabric the time taken it is actually quite a quick make so if you

69
00:05:26,144 --> 00:05:30,847
did want to make it as a gift possibly for Christmas and for serving friend it

70
00:05:30,944 --> 00:05:36,671
would work quite well firstly I'm doing it all project like this I find cutting up

71
00:05:36,768 --> 00:05:41,183
all the bits takes the longest second I'd say it's all the bias finding so that

72
00:05:41,279 --> 00:05:46,976
is quite a lot of bias finding but it's definitely want it so Avril I'm kind

73
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:52,287
of happy with the pattern I did get quite frustrated with it and and I guess

74
00:05:52,415 --> 00:05:56,351
maybe I just had a slightly different view of how it was meant to work out

75
00:05:56,608 --> 00:06:01,312
I think also it's not the easiest past him to follow if you are a beginner

76
00:06:01,471 --> 00:06:05,471
however I think most people who are going to be making I'm a mess and scrap

77
00:06:05,536 --> 00:06:11,359
catchable their own overlocker if they've got a noble aka likably have done enough serving to

78
00:06:11,455 --> 00:06:16,704
be able to make the mat anyway they grew I would recommend it because it is

79
00:06:16,768 --> 00:06:19,584
a good size and you just might want to

80
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:25,023
be a bit more creative when you're looking at the instructions on how you want to

81
00:06:25,343 --> 00:06:29,984
the final finish to look like to say I think I did deviate from it and

82
00:06:30,048 --> 00:06:34,432
side of it because I didn't want to see the rule seems within the poppets if

83
00:06:34,496 --> 00:06:36,160
I made it again I'm definitely going to

84
00:06:37,567 --> 00:06:41,664
look at this person but I might look at the way in which I can

85
00:06:43,391 --> 00:06:47,648
tweak it a bit to sleep my own need that that makes sense so see I

86
00:06:47,743 --> 00:06:51,295
mean it's amazing it's a free pass to the Dougherty someone's were tired on that and

87
00:06:51,359 --> 00:06:56,895
shared and there in time and efforts but I would have a look and you know

88
00:06:57,055 --> 00:07:00,480
don't be afraid to adjust it if you want to that's it for today thanks for

89
00:07:00,544 --> 00:07:00,928
watching
