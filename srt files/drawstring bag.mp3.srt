00:00:00,671 --> 00:00:04,671
today I'm going to show you how to make a simple lined drawstring bag as always

1
00:00:04,895 --> 00:00:07,872
like this video and would might seem more please don't forget to like unsubscribe if you

2
00:00:07,935 --> 00:00:11,776
haven't already so let's go through their materials that you need they need to cut out

3
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:16,959
to pieces of your main fabric and to pieces of your lining fabric now that will

4
00:00:16,992 --> 00:00:22,271
be the same size so you need to decide how thick you want your draw-string back

5
00:00:22,336 --> 00:00:28,096
to be so I did mine twenty-six centimeters with wise and forty two centimeters tool this

6
00:00:28,191 --> 00:00:33,631
is so that it could fit the sure that I'd made however you can decide on

7
00:00:33,695 --> 00:00:37,855
whatever measurements you want so no dust find out the size of my particular drawstring bag

8
00:00:37,984 --> 00:00:41,984
I measured how white I thought it would need to be for versal and then I

9
00:00:42,111 --> 00:00:46,335
added a bit of extra room and then I added a sent to me that either

10
00:00:46,368 --> 00:00:50,751
side so two centimeters more in total just to add some seam allowance so for their

11
00:00:50,976 --> 00:00:55,903
height I had to not only add the seam allowance I also added a bit for

12
00:00:56,032 --> 00:01:00,000
the casing so for the gaps of the casing I added one a half centimeters and

13
00:01:00,032 --> 00:01:04,192
then I wanted some and a half centimeter top to the drawstring bag of buds to

14
00:01:04,319 --> 00:01:08,736
the where would gather for the casing obviously you could just make a really small top

15
00:01:08,832 --> 00:01:13,760
section or there are some thrusting bags where the drawstring far is the top of the

16
00:01:13,791 --> 00:01:18,879
bag so it's not necessary use any to cut out either some ribbon cotton take whatever

17
00:01:18,975 --> 00:01:23,328
you're going to choose for the trimming for the drawstring section you will need to bits

18
00:01:23,391 --> 00:01:28,863
of ribbon I measured mine at sixty-eight centimeters for the smiths but essentially you need it

19
00:01:28,928 --> 00:01:35,008
to be twice the width of the bag plus about fifteen twenty centimeters have a ruler

20
00:01:35,071 --> 00:01:39,552
to hand and of fabric him it's one of those erasable times

21
00:01:41,407 --> 00:01:45,664
the first act was to put the lining pieces right sides together and then mark where

22
00:01:45,823 --> 00:01:48,800
I was going to turn the bag right side out at the end

23
00:01:59,295 --> 00:02:02,527
so I've decided that I was going to leave and opening at the bottom of the

24
00:02:02,592 --> 00:02:06,912
bag so I've just marked a short line at the base enough to turn the bag

25
00:02:07,199 --> 00:02:11,744
at the end right sides out one centimeter away from the raw edge after that I've

26
00:02:11,776 --> 00:02:15,968
put some quoting clips in just to hold the two pieces together before I saw it

27
00:02:16,031 --> 00:02:20,352
on the sewing machine so we see you could use regular pins if you want to

28
00:02:31,296 --> 00:02:33,727
so I think that all ready to go so that when I do go to the

29
00:02:33,792 --> 00:02:40,192
so machine will stitch down the two long guns and partially on the ottoman next like

30
00:02:40,255 --> 00:02:44,192
we've done to the main fabrics though again like the lining I put the right sides

31
00:02:44,255 --> 00:02:49,503
together for this one instead of putting a marking at the bottom the openings are gonna

32
00:02:49,535 --> 00:02:50,559
be for the casing

33
00:02:53,119 --> 00:02:56,095
so the opening is going to be for the casing for the ribbon or in my

34
00:02:56,255 --> 00:03:00,895
case cotton tape so I've just marked this eight and a half centimeters down because I

35
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:05,055
want my talk to be seven and a half sense meters tall and then I've just

36
00:03:05,376 --> 00:03:10,143
worked its somehow sons meters down and then another mark a feather one of the house

37
00:03:10,207 --> 00:03:12,960
lens meters down and I've done that on both sides of the bag

38
00:03:14,559 --> 00:03:19,744
they once I'd done that I leave my quoting lips again to secure the two pieces

39
00:03:19,807 --> 00:03:20,735
together into the stitch

40
00:03:23,328 --> 00:03:28,287
once I had both the main underlining fabrics together I lonely data the sewing machine and

41
00:03:28,352 --> 00:03:33,951
stitched the to side edges and the face but making sure that I didn't stitch over

42
00:03:34,399 --> 00:03:39,936
where I put my marking it's also worth noting that I did use the backstitching to

43
00:03:40,511 --> 00:03:42,496
reinforce those openings as well

44
00:04:23,776 --> 00:04:26,847
so at once I've stitched all the way rounds what I did was I trim to

45
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:31,455
the corners so I've just kept them so that when their turn for outside out they

46
00:04:31,584 --> 00:04:36,320
should have a nice Chris corner and once they were done I then means over to

47
00:04:36,384 --> 00:04:38,592
the ironing board and pressed all the scenes out

48
00:04:39,839 --> 00:04:44,256
I mean the main peace the right way out and then put it into the lining

49
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:46,111
peace which was still run sides out

50
00:04:55,776 --> 00:05:00,320
then lined them up at the top and again use my quoting clips to secure them

51
00:05:00,351 --> 00:05:03,552
together before leaving it to the same machine and stitching and together

52
00:05:08,799 --> 00:05:11,328
now because I've left a gap in the lining I didn't need to leave a gap

53
00:05:11,424 --> 00:05:15,488
up here so I've just ditched all the way through again with the one centimeter seam

54
00:05:15,519 --> 00:05:16,928
allowance which I'm using throughout

55
00:05:19,839 --> 00:05:23,488
once the stitching was done I was unable to turn the back right side out using

56
00:05:23,712 --> 00:05:27,584
that gap I left in the lining so once it was now obviously you could use

57
00:05:27,808 --> 00:05:33,119
a turning to or some sort all to pick out the corners I then stitched the

58
00:05:33,791 --> 00:05:36,096
gap in the lining or the base of the lining peace

59
00:05:38,079 --> 00:05:41,503
just using a simple slip stitch where the needle and thread

60
00:06:13,152 --> 00:06:17,696
with the hole in the lining an eye then put the mining back into the main

61
00:06:18,079 --> 00:06:24,127
peace matching the corners and the place is also worth pressing their in place just so

62
00:06:24,256 --> 00:06:28,000
you've got the top section nice and secure

63
00:06:35,552 --> 00:06:41,600
next I measured the distance between the top of the bag and the

64
00:06:43,135 --> 00:06:48,575
edge of the halls of the casing so I receive because I planned it to be

65
00:06:48,671 --> 00:06:52,384
some nuts centimeters that is roughly what it turned up to be but then I measured

66
00:06:52,415 --> 00:06:55,328
it on my sewing machine and you to get what she said just so I could

67
00:06:55,359 --> 00:06:56,032
use as a guide

68
00:06:57,088 --> 00:07:00,768
now because the top of this drawstring bag is quite generous

69
00:07:01,791 --> 00:07:06,911
I was to be easier if you do decide to make a smaller top bit over

70
00:07:06,976 --> 00:07:11,872
your casing just because you can either use the markings on your so machine or

71
00:07:13,152 --> 00:07:16,480
you don't have to get as far up the staring machine as I have here but

72
00:07:16,704 --> 00:07:21,888
anyway so once I had stitched the top line for the casing I then use the

73
00:07:22,144 --> 00:07:27,584
edge of my crusta fit as a guide to work out where to evenly sich the

74
00:07:27,648 --> 00:07:29,088
bottom line of the casing

75
00:07:42,656 --> 00:07:48,096
one says to raise of stitching were complete I then go on to adding the carton

76
00:07:48,223 --> 00:07:52,671
tape so I've used the method where you get a safety pin that you attach it

77
00:07:52,735 --> 00:07:56,992
to your take over them and then you guys it through the casing it just gets

78
00:07:57,055 --> 00:08:04,032
a little bit stuck at the same announces just because I didn't stitch these down before

79
00:08:04,191 --> 00:08:08,864
so I ended up using a leap Turner I think and also my turning out to

80
00:08:09,407 --> 00:08:15,135
it just helped widen the casing there at the end so that I could guide the

81
00:08:15,231 --> 00:08:19,903
tapes through so what you do as she put one take through one hole but it

82
00:08:20,032 --> 00:08:23,743
all the way around so leaps back and comes out the same and and then you

83
00:08:23,839 --> 00:08:28,735
need to get your second piece of table ribbon and do the same thing again but

84
00:08:28,799 --> 00:08:31,455
from the other opening on the other side of the bag

85
00:08:33,216 --> 00:08:38,752
finally you need to tie the ends of your ribbon or potentate so I've just done

86
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:41,088
a simple not on both thesis

87
00:09:02,143 --> 00:09:07,424
so though you have it that's how you make a simple lines drawstring bag obviously there's

88
00:09:07,903 --> 00:09:12,159
a number of ways that you can customize it for yourself and making it a different

89
00:09:12,223 --> 00:09:19,487
size deciding how much overtop you want you can use ribbon cotton tape other trimmings for

90
00:09:19,616 --> 00:09:23,872
the drawstring parts and obviously and it's a great sash master as well and a good

91
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,359
way to store various items that's it for this time thanks for watching
