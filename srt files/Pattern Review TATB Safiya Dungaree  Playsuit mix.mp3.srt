today I'm reviewing this to peer person as always if you like this video and would

1
00:00:04,064 --> 00:00:07,136
like to see more please they forget to like and subscribe if you haven't already in

2
00:00:07,199 --> 00:00:11,935
case so this is the Safiya pattern which is from the make it simple book by

3
00:00:12,095 --> 00:00:16,959
talion button now I've done a bit of a mash-up out of two of the variations

4
00:00:17,024 --> 00:00:22,656
so there is a dungarees variation of severe and there is a place you version what

5
00:00:22,719 --> 00:00:27,295
I've done is I've used the top section of the numbers and the bottom section of

6
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:31,615
the place seat how of this is because I quite like the idea of the short

7
00:00:31,680 --> 00:00:36,192
version for face sections I cut out the signs for it's probably quite obvious to some

8
00:00:36,223 --> 00:00:39,807
of you that this is an old person I thought that will be good to use

9
00:00:39,967 --> 00:00:44,352
an old bit of fabric from my stash because I wanted to show how this would

10
00:00:44,383 --> 00:00:48,287
turn out and I don't want to read a nice about fabric in the process I

11
00:00:48,383 --> 00:00:54,048
found this fabric really easy to work with its brightness picking cotton and it was a

12
00:00:54,271 --> 00:00:58,720
dream to say with some for the difficulty of this pattern the most challenging part naturally

13
00:00:58,784 --> 00:01:05,279
for me was to match the two variations together it does suggest during this variation in

14
00:01:05,311 --> 00:01:09,407
the book but it doesn't give you the guidance on which sets to follow when I

15
00:01:09,503 --> 00:01:13,472
mean it's not too difficult to do this because they do but each other really well

16
00:01:13,599 --> 00:01:19,711
you don't have to you know breed apart us to fit into the short section it's

17
00:01:20,031 --> 00:01:25,664
pretty straightforward however what I wasn't sure when was whether to go with the tie on

18
00:01:26,111 --> 00:01:31,391
the waste or whether he is the elastic so I kind of made it at first

19
00:01:31,456 --> 00:01:35,872
without the elastic but I oversleep still have the length with the waist band in there

20
00:01:35,968 --> 00:01:41,311
so obviously if you did want to make the degrees version with the time version you

21
00:01:41,407 --> 00:01:45,344
do need to remember to take out about for an hadland meters they rather than it

22
00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:48,863
leaves that bit of fabric it is what really cut it out to have the way

23
00:01:48,991 --> 00:01:54,047
to span section I just decided to give the elastic to go which I'm pretty happy

24
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:59,711
with and say the most challenging apart personally for me was making these little narrow straps

25
00:01:59,968 --> 00:02:03,136
as essential part of the time maybe a good hour or so with me from him

26
00:02:03,263 --> 00:02:08,000
to return the straps right side out normally I just you and I end up stitching

27
00:02:08,063 --> 00:02:12,255
it Rome sides together and just for dinner this was even now inspired I thought I'm

28
00:02:12,287 --> 00:02:16,255
gonna do it properly this time and I did get there eventually but it did take

29
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:20,063
a while there is a good tip in the book where you and have an extra

30
00:02:20,128 --> 00:02:24,800
length of thread which you talk him so that it can help you turn your thrap

31
00:02:24,927 --> 00:02:31,039
right side out it's worked with limited success for me so the first one if after

32
00:02:31,615 --> 00:02:35,455
a fair bit of encouragement I managed to get it through the other one I managed

33
00:02:35,488 --> 00:02:38,783
to snap pretty much Sri always you do have to be careful with that method but

34
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:44,576
with a bit about missing needle and one of those really don't know I'm told you

35
00:02:44,639 --> 00:02:48,671
know they're no messages of the little you can that over the end I did manage

36
00:02:48,768 --> 00:02:51,968
to get them broke through in the end as you can see the clarity of instructions

37
00:02:52,063 --> 00:02:56,095
they are very clear as I mentioned the main struggle for me was just making sure

38
00:02:56,192 --> 00:03:00,000
I matched up the two different patterns at the right time for the design of fit

39
00:03:00,352 --> 00:03:03,744
I am quite happy with this they do think you need to be careful with your

40
00:03:04,095 --> 00:03:08,735
measurements do very quite a lot you do need to keep a mindset you've got to

41
00:03:09,024 --> 00:03:15,231
pull this dungaree Patton up over your hips so the opening of talk needs to be

42
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:19,072
big enough for that this wasn't a problem me I didn't feel a little it's not

43
00:03:19,136 --> 00:03:22,912
when it gets to the habit action but that could be more an issue for someone

44
00:03:23,039 --> 00:03:26,848
else do you do need to pay attention to the instructions where it seems that you

45
00:03:26,944 --> 00:03:30,432
need to make sure I think you have to choose the past in possibly by your

46
00:03:30,464 --> 00:03:36,352
hip size and even if your bus lines is a lot smaller they recommend not grading

47
00:03:36,992 --> 00:03:39,807
if you do great do you need to add the fastening such as the sun I

48
00:03:39,871 --> 00:03:45,024
do quite like the elastic version his so I think it looks quite nice it makes

49
00:03:45,119 --> 00:03:48,671
it a lot more intense than it would have been I do think it would look

50
00:03:48,735 --> 00:03:52,287
quite nice with the times well though so you could just and cut off about that

51
00:03:52,479 --> 00:03:58,048
length not do that spans and then as the tie that is in the book for

52
00:03:58,240 --> 00:04:02,048
the full next unburies version it's really difficult for me today how long this took me

53
00:04:02,367 --> 00:04:07,488
and to be honest the book doesn't tell you how to make this particular variation because

54
00:04:07,679 --> 00:04:11,679
it's not an official variation in the book it's just the suggestion to be honest I

55
00:04:12,576 --> 00:04:16,704
lost track of time with this mainly prepares I did kind of make it without the

56
00:04:16,768 --> 00:04:21,216
waistband but still have the length then I had to unpick in it then I created

57
00:04:21,247 --> 00:04:24,992
the waist and it was the managed to because you know it's got a flat front

58
00:04:25,183 --> 00:04:26,911
on this wasteland I managed to to

59
00:04:27,967 --> 00:04:33,376
mark out the flat section I stand on the back not sure why anyway then I

60
00:04:33,471 --> 00:04:39,040
had to research the back and pick the front reattach the elastic

61
00:04:40,895 --> 00:04:45,312
but fortunately actually and stitch the elastically place when I put it back to front so

62
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:47,135
I just have to you take the pens out

63
00:04:48,384 --> 00:04:52,351
but yeah I did a few gets wrong not sure that just because I'm tired or

64
00:04:52,415 --> 00:04:56,320
I just want I'm paying attention so to complete I am really happy with these I

65
00:04:56,447 --> 00:05:02,272
actually quite like this old curtain material or the fabric for this and I think it

66
00:05:02,303 --> 00:05:05,984
looks really nice with a plain white t-shirt it's like sick it would actually go room

67
00:05:06,079 --> 00:05:10,015
nicely with the tablet the teacher I made the last time which is part of my

68
00:05:10,111 --> 00:05:13,664
pajama set and I've really tempted to just where I was a regular top from the

69
00:05:13,727 --> 00:05:17,343
the of John atop I'd be lying them as my pajamas this week and they're really

70
00:05:17,407 --> 00:05:24,735
company so I do recommend making Luhmann's John it's nice and company the elasticated waist I

71
00:05:24,832 --> 00:05:28,671
think that's making it a bit more flattering one thing that is a shame is that

72
00:05:28,704 --> 00:05:32,671
you can't use the pocket person on this I don't know if you could if you

73
00:05:32,768 --> 00:05:39,424
made official a bit longer but it does want the slide seem Hawkins that you can

74
00:05:39,519 --> 00:05:45,471
make the Scythia traceurs they are too long for making for the place in saying that

75
00:05:45,567 --> 00:05:50,079
lot joy and a patch pocket either to this and firstly with this I guess the

76
00:05:50,144 --> 00:05:55,391
person's just a bit is the anyway so it looks nice without it but I'm not

77
00:05:55,455 --> 00:05:59,584
sure even if I put his pocket on here is quite nice just having a claim

78
00:05:59,712 --> 00:06:04,160
to that it for this week I do have a hundred day product video of which

79
00:06:04,287 --> 00:06:07,839
I'll be releasing later on today and I'll be carrying on with that but otherwise I'll

80
00:06:07,903 --> 00:06:12,287
have another general throwing related video next week that's what chicken
