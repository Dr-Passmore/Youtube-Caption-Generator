1
00:00:04,992 --> 00:00:08,288
like to see more please don't forget to like and subscribe if you haven't already does

2
00:00:08,352 --> 00:00:13,663
I mentioned this is a buttering pattern it is pattern of five one eight nine and

3
00:00:13,760 --> 00:00:18,912
the path of the pact collis's of a dressing gown so that's trusting and there's no

4
00:00:19,040 --> 00:00:24,799
other variations of the dressing gown and and also John Michelle there's also a lady's best

5
00:00:24,832 --> 00:00:28,864
that you can make though I have actually made the pajama shorts on this pattern which

6
00:00:29,055 --> 00:00:33,631
come out really well but today I'm going to focus on the dressing gown in particular

7
00:00:33,855 --> 00:00:37,919
they pass and I've got it from a charity shop so I've only got two sizes

8
00:00:38,368 --> 00:00:42,431
I've got the large and extra village and I've made it in the large so I

9
00:00:42,591 --> 00:00:42,847
kind of

10
00:00:44,383 --> 00:00:49,472
added a bit of extra padding to my address was to try and and show you

11
00:00:49,568 --> 00:00:53,215
what it looks like as I don't have the model here to hand as it is

12
00:00:53,279 --> 00:00:56,799
a gift which I'm giving away shortly okay so maybe hand to the fabric that I've

13
00:00:56,863 --> 00:01:01,504
used so as you can see I'm used this sort of polyester vocate on the advice

14
00:01:02,271 --> 00:01:07,839
and on the lining I've used this Terry cloth fabric so one thing that I did

15
00:01:07,903 --> 00:01:14,304
encounter because the teraflops more than net fabric and the outside of women fabric I did

16
00:01:14,367 --> 00:01:19,232
think to bear that in mind as I stitched other issues that brocades quite slippery sini

17
00:01:19,328 --> 00:01:22,879
to be extra careful and I needed to be careful and passed a matching the pocket

18
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:26,335
skills to me to make sure that it doesn't go out of alignment when you're cutting

19
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:30,559
it so I spent quite a lot of time just laying out the fabric for a

20
00:01:30,655 --> 00:01:33,888
cause the pieces out I didn't need to worry as much with Terry cloth because there

21
00:01:33,919 --> 00:01:39,136
was no pattern however the Terry cloth gave absolutely everywhere and still finding bits of red

22
00:01:39,263 --> 00:01:46,816
flush and all sorts of places yes there's a big cleanup mission after use ahistorical inside

23
00:01:46,879 --> 00:01:50,335
nicely I got both of these at fabric lines I actually got it at the source

24
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:54,527
free store which is now close but they do have other branches and an online shop

25
00:01:54,655 --> 00:01:59,487
in times of difficulty I'd say this is for a co-operative beginner depending on the fabric

26
00:01:59,552 --> 00:02:04,160
you use can make it easier or harder for you I think that I've chosen quite

27
00:02:04,255 --> 00:02:10,527
challenging fabrics personally but you know some people might love these potential of that breaks as

28
00:02:10,591 --> 00:02:14,591
I mentioned that the raids really slippery and you've got to be careful with that it's

29
00:02:14,656 --> 00:02:19,423
also not that forgiving and you need to be carefully to maggots with the Terry clock

30
00:02:19,583 --> 00:02:23,552
again because it's Strachey you've got the challenge and make it sure that doesn't stretch out

31
00:02:23,583 --> 00:02:29,472
of shape and all so that the materials and sit nicely together at the end though

32
00:02:30,272 --> 00:02:34,399
I'd say that's why I wouldn't say it's a complete beginner because I get a lot

33
00:02:34,432 --> 00:02:38,143
of people were going to choose a tanning of outbreak of some sort if you use

34
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:41,983
a regular toweling fabric without stretch it might be a bit easier but it depends how

35
00:02:42,175 --> 00:02:46,304
thick it is because then you might encounter issues with your sewing machine color saying that

36
00:02:46,432 --> 00:02:51,199
there's no real challenging fastenings on here there's a bit at the top where there is

37
00:02:51,264 --> 00:02:55,744
a sharp corner which is quite challenging but say that's the most difficult part minus adding

38
00:02:55,871 --> 00:03:00,735
patch once you know you don't have to add any Zim's no buttonhooks of fastenings the

39
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:04,447
only fastening you put is this time at the front which is them separately and it's

40
00:03:04,544 --> 00:03:10,175
very simple ingested the bits together and turn right side out and slip-stitch at the turtle

41
00:03:10,207 --> 00:03:15,744
wise it's very simple it's just whatever you choose the your fabric thing that does my

42
00:03:15,839 --> 00:03:20,384
luck topstitching which can be quite challenging when you're a beginner but if you choose quite

43
00:03:20,576 --> 00:03:26,111
busy pattern on the outside or it might just drown in the telling fabric if you

44
00:03:26,175 --> 00:03:29,983
did time in on the applied so it's not necessarily too much of a problem in

45
00:03:30,048 --> 00:03:34,688
terms of clarity I found the instructions to be really clear it is a nice person

46
00:03:34,783 --> 00:03:39,296
to follow the only bit I found confusing and I didn't really get was how to

47
00:03:39,391 --> 00:03:43,583
do that him so I just did my own thing to be honest what I did

48
00:03:43,712 --> 00:03:48,735
was I trends to him so that it was level then I pressed up the Hamelin's

49
00:03:49,664 --> 00:03:56,320
pinned it in place slip-stitch it all together and then topstitch to the bottom I'm not

50
00:03:56,384 --> 00:04:00,992
sure that's what the instructions say though I write it numerous times that I just could

51
00:04:01,024 --> 00:04:05,503
have understand it it might be if I ever made again I realized what I did

52
00:04:05,567 --> 00:04:10,240
room but yeah that was the only with that kind of confused me maybe want to

53
00:04:10,304 --> 00:04:14,783
design and fence I love the design of this person I'm not sure how much I

54
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:17,791
can really say about the fifth I have tried it on so that it is a

55
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:22,272
little bit big for me and so I guess so many build to tell when the

56
00:04:22,399 --> 00:04:25,791
recipient tried it on and took to all that them all they saying that I am

57
00:04:25,855 --> 00:04:28,799
a bit concerned it might be a little bit big for them as well I really

58
00:04:28,895 --> 00:04:33,471
like this design and the reason I to that out of the other dressing down patterns

59
00:04:33,567 --> 00:04:37,855
that I have in my stash is because I like the fact that it does have

60
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:44,928
a separate lining and exterior this color particulars reeling icy get to show off that riverside

61
00:04:45,055 --> 00:04:50,528
it's our lovely roomy pocket and you got these lovely big cuffs which again turned up

62
00:04:50,656 --> 00:04:53,824
the you get to show up that Terry cloth again hearing thing I would say is

63
00:04:53,888 --> 00:04:59,967
it doesn't have any taps for attaching the time however this is quite a personal preference

64
00:05:00,032 --> 00:05:05,536
and waited position it and I was thinking of making the loops that the times but

65
00:05:06,015 --> 00:05:10,528
I will rumblingly to see how it hangs on the person because I don't want to

66
00:05:10,623 --> 00:05:14,528
position it in the wrong place but it would be good to have something there are

67
00:05:14,623 --> 00:05:18,111
the ways that going to have to put this in the pocket of the dressing old

68
00:05:18,175 --> 00:05:21,503
or put its one side every time they wear it both if you had some belt

69
00:05:21,567 --> 00:05:25,824
loops of the sides it would just keep it in place when you do take it

70
00:05:25,888 --> 00:05:31,295
off the time taken I did this gradually over a few weeks so it's again a

71
00:05:31,328 --> 00:05:35,104
bit tricky to work out I spent quite a bit of time cutting it out because

72
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:42,335
of the challenging fabrics and that was probably the most time-consuming part that construction was I

73
00:05:42,432 --> 00:05:47,455
probably spend about three days on you definitely with this up in a few days and

74
00:05:47,679 --> 00:05:52,256
possibly quicker with an easier fabric so I brought its the big comes up from me

75
00:05:52,895 --> 00:05:57,727
I really enjoyed making it and if I could find this person in my own size

76
00:05:57,855 --> 00:06:01,855
I definitely give it a go it's really nice I just like the overall

77
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:07,295
design of it I think it looks quite comfy and I hope the last night make

78
00:06:07,359 --> 00:06:10,623
it more will enjoy it that's it for this time thanks for watching
