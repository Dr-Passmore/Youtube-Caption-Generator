hello today I am reviewing simplicity pattern one three eight five which is a mixture of

1
00:00:09,951 --> 00:00:11,616
lunch bags and Arkady's

2
00:00:12,640 --> 00:00:17,024
I have made lunch bag Virginie and which is next to me here

3
00:00:18,559 --> 00:00:23,327
now if you've seen my pattern review or time lapse of the market tote by Mikhoels

4
00:00:23,808 --> 00:00:29,120
you will have noticed that I've used the exact same fabric combination I was going to

5
00:00:29,215 --> 00:00:35,231
use a different fabric from my stash however the person who's going to receive this as

6
00:00:35,296 --> 00:00:41,312
a gift saw the market tote and love the fabric on it so I decided to

7
00:00:41,375 --> 00:00:43,104
use the remnants for this instead

8
00:00:45,535 --> 00:00:52,032
so I've used to different fabrics but in the pattern it bites cutting out into three

9
00:00:52,159 --> 00:00:57,472
sections there's the main fabric which is I'm this part and all the pockets

10
00:00:59,104 --> 00:01:04,480
the contrast fabric which is underneath the pockets and on the face as well as the

11
00:01:04,575 --> 00:01:07,391
strap and there's also the lining

12
00:01:08,447 --> 00:01:14,496
which is inside so as you can see if I combined the contrast fabric and the

13
00:01:14,655 --> 00:01:20,863
lining sections and purely at a preference but it would be quite good to make the

14
00:01:20,959 --> 00:01:26,176
mining out of waterproof fabric if you have some as it would just make it a

15
00:01:26,208 --> 00:01:27,711
bit more practical than lunch bag

16
00:01:29,472 --> 00:01:35,295
other iceman's you need to complete this pattern is interlining and you need it for both

17
00:01:35,391 --> 00:01:38,751
the exterior and interior sections of this project

18
00:01:40,384 --> 00:01:43,071
and this just gives it a bit more stability and structure

19
00:01:44,704 --> 00:01:52,223
you also need thermal wedding and this is to create insulation for the lunch bag so

20
00:01:52,255 --> 00:01:53,856
it will help keep it cool in the summer

21
00:01:56,351 --> 00:02:00,736
and this then awarding and you can use for example to make Aben gloves as well

22
00:02:02,431 --> 00:02:04,384
the other thing you need is felt grow

23
00:02:06,111 --> 00:02:09,792
as you can see you don't need to much about crows so I'm the stuff I've

24
00:02:09,824 --> 00:02:14,464
used here am I got from the supermarket so you don't need to go you to

25
00:02:14,975 --> 00:02:17,600
a haberdashery in particular and for this

26
00:02:19,296 --> 00:02:19,776
fastening

27
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:27,328
I found this a simple pattern to follow and it's got lots of markers and notches

28
00:02:27,455 --> 00:02:32,639
to ensure that you and place different elements such as the side pockets in the right

29
00:02:32,703 --> 00:02:33,055
place

30
00:02:34,399 --> 00:02:37,824
there's also a marker for placing the velcroed

31
00:02:39,615 --> 00:02:45,087
I almost forgot to add the boat grow onto the main back section and but that

32
00:02:45,408 --> 00:02:48,927
is complete oversight on my part it is in the instructions

33
00:02:50,464 --> 00:02:56,800
and it also has the same announces printed on the fabric pieces I found this very

34
00:02:56,863 --> 00:03:04,479
useful and in order to pattern match this front section with the front flap and just

35
00:03:04,608 --> 00:03:07,583
that my the fox on the front came out well

36
00:03:08,671 --> 00:03:13,119
you don't think I would say about the Velcro is and to watch out and for

37
00:03:13,567 --> 00:03:16,416
the teeth side snagging on your sewing machine

38
00:03:17,792 --> 00:03:23,072
in the past of had trouble with Velcro because I've seen too close to the teeth

39
00:03:23,167 --> 00:03:29,695
section and its caught on the threads so just make sure you stitch on the very

40
00:03:29,919 --> 00:03:37,919
edge of the teeth section to avoid this or attentively could hand stature if you're not

41
00:03:37,983 --> 00:03:38,591
too often

42
00:03:40,927 --> 00:03:45,919
the instructions are very clear and strode forward if I had no trouble whatsoever in making

43
00:03:45,983 --> 00:03:47,104
this lunch bag

44
00:03:48,416 --> 00:03:53,311
it did make the snap pouch well and for this I had a slight issue with

45
00:03:53,408 --> 00:03:53,535
it

46
00:03:55,936 --> 00:03:59,296
with this snap pouch and you had boat crew for the

47
00:04:00,703 --> 00:04:01,279
fastenings

48
00:04:02,815 --> 00:04:06,815
and it's not lined with thermal wedding by the way I'm it's just a simple

49
00:04:08,287 --> 00:04:09,695
main fabric and aligning

50
00:04:11,136 --> 00:04:16,000
with the Velcro I wasn't sure whether to place at a quarter of an inch or

51
00:04:16,063 --> 00:04:20,704
a half inch from the raw edge and I believe it was probably half an inch

52
00:04:21,023 --> 00:04:22,847
the same as for the side

53
00:04:24,704 --> 00:04:31,231
as a result it means that I my topstitching has stitched into the Velcro pieces

54
00:04:32,511 --> 00:04:35,903
it's not if you just you but it's something to bear in mind

55
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:43,552
with regards to the fist and design my compliment too much as it is a gift

56
00:04:44,415 --> 00:04:49,696
however I would say it's the standard lunch bag size M is quite roomy so you

57
00:04:49,791 --> 00:04:55,264
could get a decent pat lunch I really like the factor has the side pockets and

58
00:04:55,648 --> 00:05:00,928
that night easy access to a Mac such as a serial bar old shop while

59
00:05:02,175 --> 00:05:03,776
I think you could probably add

60
00:05:05,279 --> 00:05:10,335
a couple of pocket inside as well which might be quite nice and you could either

61
00:05:10,432 --> 00:05:17,023
add it to the center back as a patch pocket or you could mimic the outside

62
00:05:17,119 --> 00:05:20,895
pockets and add pockets on the site in the lining

63
00:05:23,872 --> 00:05:28,447
the anything I would say about the design I think it's really good

64
00:05:29,536 --> 00:05:34,656
apart from the strap those get a bit and the way of opening the lunch bag

65
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,455
however I think this is something which will give a bit more over time

66
00:05:40,992 --> 00:05:43,712
even now it's it seemed to be easier to get into

67
00:05:46,335 --> 00:05:51,615
this took me a few hours to make and that's not including cutting out and attaching

68
00:05:51,872 --> 00:05:52,735
the interlining

69
00:05:54,335 --> 00:05:59,424
I thought it was quite a simple straightforward to make I would definitely make it again

70
00:06:00,191 --> 00:06:04,671
and may even adapt it to make across over bag as it quite a nice design

71
00:06:04,735 --> 00:06:09,631
and shape but we would need to do is length in this strap and so that

72
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:12,384
it can go round accordion over your shoulder
