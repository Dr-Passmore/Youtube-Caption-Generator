11
00:01:00,703 --> 00:01:01,919
I saw it absolutely years ago

12
00:01:04,064 --> 00:01:08,416
for you is probably like at least a definite hope it's one of those city things

13
00:01:08,832 --> 00:01:09,599
yeah where they give you

14
00:01:10,783 --> 00:01:14,847
the magazine every week the board of world you meant to make a sweat and you

15
00:01:14,912 --> 00:01:17,632
think you know and then gradually and bring to make this very minute to just keep

16
00:01:17,695 --> 00:01:22,496
local bowl aside and it never gets done so it's been to be made out of

17
00:01:22,559 --> 00:01:25,440
line it was the times at how about she made over half of them I just

18
00:01:25,472 --> 00:01:25,727
haven't

19
00:01:27,263 --> 00:01:31,711
asked me so I called down the other heart I have kept kept all all the

20
00:01:31,776 --> 00:01:35,232
wall I don't think about the instructions for the knights of life now

21
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:41,279
I'll just make them out for just a small part to cedrus looking stage where you

22
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:46,176
will have only by frantic adjust your rouble night but yes if this week I managed

23
00:01:46,208 --> 00:01:50,496
to sew up some of the priest and some of this one's together so that the

24
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:56,447
a bit more manageable it actually takes us uprising like a planter so up nine slides

25
00:01:56,512 --> 00:01:57,120
with backstitch

26
00:01:58,272 --> 00:02:00,543
so see I've done the best lock of mine

27
00:02:02,176 --> 00:02:02,559
and

28
00:02:03,839 --> 00:02:06,463
I just finished the second block of mines well

29
00:02:07,711 --> 00:02:11,776
so another thing mentions I have been missing the flares in the warder I get so

30
00:02:12,352 --> 00:02:12,800
I've got

31
00:02:14,751 --> 00:02:18,207
probably like say why ever have missed it up first I can't make

32
00:02:22,496 --> 00:02:25,727
sense of mine I call it all up story away for it is I need to

33
00:02:26,527 --> 00:02:30,272
finish some of the other squares because I've been just getting their fancy don't not masses

34
00:02:30,496 --> 00:02:34,080
you know I'm tired of stuffing such are going to I'm going to do one of

35
00:02:34,143 --> 00:02:36,895
the chainstitch heart and and sent

36
00:02:39,007 --> 00:02:41,695
I guess the ones I for about the most so ones where you're doing a person

37
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:42,335
so

38
00:02:43,552 --> 00:02:45,600
like on this one to missing up the treat

39
00:02:47,936 --> 00:02:51,039
this somehow again the words to that so

40
00:02:52,576 --> 00:02:56,992
yeah it's been a very slowly and so this is a hand like wavy leather stitched

41
00:02:57,055 --> 00:02:57,600
and going on know

42
00:02:58,848 --> 00:03:02,240
that yet we I don't know it's one of those but I like the ones where

43
00:03:02,559 --> 00:03:07,296
you don't have to change the young color and you doing a bit pattern so isn't

44
00:03:07,391 --> 00:03:12,320
she that when I was making this originally I started just prioritising with those so-called as

45
00:03:12,384 --> 00:03:17,664
of what I time as Delawares to make now but I kind of feel like now

46
00:03:17,792 --> 00:03:20,863
is a good time as I need to finally get up onto this and I would

47
00:03:20,895 --> 00:03:24,800
quite like to put this time in the end on the answer was quiet and let

48
00:03:24,927 --> 00:03:29,888
that you live in front of the agreement at the moment at the cooler

49
00:03:30,944 --> 00:03:37,503
heaven and so it might replace the green through all my also to you got time

50
00:03:37,535 --> 00:03:42,975
of the terror munching on the left surrounded it you say that but I'm still of

51
00:03:43,039 --> 00:03:47,807
the work remaining niggaz tree and you start a new job so for the company has

52
00:03:47,871 --> 00:03:53,151
its usual prevailing yeah I'm all they saying like you haven't been in Europe for that

53
00:03:53,184 --> 00:03:55,552
but I know to his long a few months

54
00:03:57,951 --> 00:04:00,063
now working extra days is idolizes for

55
00:04:01,408 --> 00:04:01,503
so

56
00:04:02,848 --> 00:04:03,488
it's exhausting

57
00:04:04,895 --> 00:04:10,623
if I hadn't happened right here it's mainly due to patentable the about work than that

58
00:04:10,944 --> 00:04:13,055
let's make sure that they can work mostly

59
00:04:14,656 --> 00:04:16,480
shuttle June anabolic systems which

60
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:24,480
haven't been testing the Sobibor to us all new territory under so because I'm you things

61
00:04:24,671 --> 00:04:26,015
well we're both using

62
00:04:27,391 --> 00:04:35,264
this kind of misero so I got a craft Romans and so for a corner of

63
00:04:35,328 --> 00:04:41,376
this room where did have a death and so he's using Mr thanks there at the

64
00:04:41,407 --> 00:04:48,351
movements and feverously I've had to use the room as well to work remotely so it's

65
00:04:48,415 --> 00:04:50,816
kind of encouraged of my right normally so

66
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:57,312
many quite particular but having the your special so in space use the element of the

67
00:04:57,376 --> 00:04:59,455
intrusion to the manage to

68
00:05:02,783 --> 00:05:04,256
you know I guess the trouble is

69
00:05:06,335 --> 00:05:10,911
over seeking way I see some face and we don't have to commute to the moment

70
00:05:11,104 --> 00:05:16,191
which is fancy but I'm so not getting grounds are just clearing of the table of

71
00:05:16,256 --> 00:05:20,864
wine the saliva news is you you no trace and that our passengers I'm just finding

72
00:05:21,023 --> 00:05:26,015
that part because I've been back much of my mind Oh great again after that little

73
00:05:26,048 --> 00:05:30,623
up again in the morning and and especially ribbon you know we're free long sleeping this

74
00:05:30,687 --> 00:05:33,791
world and for that stretchable was given so

75
00:05:35,424 --> 00:05:41,023
getting up to that later below to trinity so I don't really want to be setting

76
00:05:41,119 --> 00:05:44,864
out and this munting it continually it's just nice to have out there really came from

77
00:05:44,928 --> 00:05:49,247
it like having a craftly that's the one to tell you were gonna take notice the

78
00:05:49,312 --> 00:05:54,303
table in our living area of the minute but what I'm going to do leaving for

79
00:05:54,368 --> 00:05:59,295
it is tracing the patent I want to do to the next to you projects and

80
00:05:59,488 --> 00:06:05,119
how the fabrics overly do that in the next day also yet with the stuff cut

81
00:06:05,216 --> 00:06:08,959

82
00:06:09,055 --> 00:06:13,216
hopefully you know when I am on my laundry before another work I can just take

85
00:06:22,079 --> 00:06:26,208
it some will use we shall give you a guide on the time spruced-up so I

86
00:06:26,303 --> 00:06:31,552
think my last video is that our stated going to with the olive pinnacle or disappear

87
00:06:32,256 --> 00:06:38,847
dungaree next however I shall change my mind it is some gripping Babatunde of and in

88
00:06:38,976 --> 00:06:42,463
the the grave of sweet so now I'm thinking I might make the genome Germans but

89
00:06:42,528 --> 00:06:47,648
breathing treat the short sension but the teachers the duchy the side of the teachers other

90
00:06:48,895 --> 00:06:52,544
so I just think they will be and deceit the game from the the book it

91
00:06:52,575 --> 00:06:53,503
stated that

92
00:06:54,847 --> 00:06:58,399
kind of like need to sit with to make to wait me and don't think and

93
00:06:58,432 --> 00:07:03,519
I get used to of neurotically going to wind down a side of work

94
00:07:06,239 --> 00:07:12,447
with you you so you see what the UK government currently it's obviously this can change

95
00:07:12,575 --> 00:07:16,704
by the time I report at the time I had it and publish this video at

96
00:07:16,735 --> 00:07:21,920
the amendment the UK government is an allowing people to go out their homes to buy

97
00:07:22,399 --> 00:07:27,455
a central such as I'm food and to pick up medication and you can also go

98
00:07:27,584 --> 00:07:33,279
out for this fact size once today look so I went for a run this morning

99
00:07:33,536 --> 00:07:38,432

100
00:07:38,463 --> 00:07:42,880
to wait to the commission to you again cilices came to Dr where the will to

101
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:50,048
appoint a point of all under the stress so the hay introducing solacing with the jewel

102
00:07:50,111 --> 00:07:55,712
assumption that one another character I got quite a nighting furmity I mean I do like

103
00:07:55,808 --> 00:08:00,191
the body to keep things but it's actually a pretty decent you see and I'd say

104
00:08:00,287 --> 00:08:03,584
that's one of the your back the moans of all the curtains on the one other

105
00:08:03,712 --> 00:08:05,760
once again he's being the paint by a lot today

106
00:08:07,167 --> 00:08:07,391
yes

107
00:08:09,055 --> 00:08:13,503
muddy thing that I want lots of training and putting out is truly the thought and

108
00:08:13,536 --> 00:08:20,959
of what leader and Emily nation medicine somatically the at that age I am a redisplays

109
00:08:21,343 --> 00:08:24,511
contenta really slow it cutting out

110
00:08:25,696 --> 00:08:32,799
and projects another it might take me the whole weekend also you something very contented they

111
00:08:33,119 --> 00:08:36,607
came from one any other any other ways that you have from the unwind do I

112
00:08:36,703 --> 00:08:40,736
got my crown help us to give up what you got

113
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:50,176
any transphysical to interested only in the round cylindrical super hope so when I put it

114
00:08:50,848 --> 00:08:53,984
was it anything I know about again the just pass that the text

115
00:08:55,296 --> 00:08:55,840
the extra clothes

116
00:08:58,111 --> 00:09:03,168
so very use a low wall and but when we have to come ashore and were

117
00:09:03,263 --> 00:09:08,799
all day watching and there is not waiting for water now half-a-million you which is Disney

118
00:09:09,023 --> 00:09:09,728
mortices

119
00:09:11,296 --> 00:09:16,000
and say watching at a friend the ocean would that have to confront you know yet

120
00:09:16,127 --> 00:09:20,768
the hunting that turned up this week so I got the railing coverage for some of

121
00:09:20,799 --> 00:09:25,440
the projects that things and he forgot you three the only the prize we are truly

122
00:09:25,504 --> 00:09:27,455
does so this is expensive of

123
00:09:28,799 --> 00:09:33,823
this is the great British sewing these the tangles title but and which hippie means that

124
00:09:33,919 --> 00:09:39,072
the new series will be handing it mean that that might give this to distraction and

125
00:09:39,104 --> 00:09:45,599
the soul present day by to consider this is what I really recorded it

126
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:52,512
yes this discuss the castle and follow the ranch I wonder if they're going to stagger

127
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:58,111
the you know to spread out the new content really so that

128
00:10:00,831 --> 00:10:04,640
it bites I think this one day things where you know that some of the projects

129
00:10:04,736 --> 00:10:08,768
might be in the production so you didn't know who would really have a proper look

130
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:14,656
at me and they might spoil the surprise and I'm saying that the three the three

131
00:10:14,752 --> 00:10:19,648
different changes on them in the program so they'd probably looking out of everything in this

132
00:10:19,744 --> 00:10:24,223
book anyway know you can be safer to get for the other the nice surprise of

133
00:10:24,288 --> 00:10:29,375
the enemy stand up but it is critical and reason but somehow I didn't remember Aldrin

134
00:10:29,695 --> 00:10:35,583
it was to been a long point back string to free yeah maybe a few the

135
00:10:35,711 --> 00:10:40,416
feeling certain we gave for it to be work when you're happy with actually been sitting

136
00:10:40,575 --> 00:10:46,528
and agree I make everything out that said that was like twenty seven project or to

137
00:10:46,559 --> 00:10:46,624
go

138
00:10:50,976 --> 00:10:51,296
every day

139
00:10:54,815 --> 00:10:57,280
and there's white fancy dress all the back here in which

140
00:10:58,335 --> 00:11:01,567
I didn't about any occasion to where you know this one a dress up in the

141
00:11:01,632 --> 00:11:01,984
planet

142
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:06,367
careful times

143
00:11:07,711 --> 00:11:15,072
they say for all yeah and hopefully next week I'll need something and I'll be unsure

144
00:11:15,648 --> 00:11:16,736
thanks for watching I
