hello today I'm reviewing the fray address which is in the book stretch by to be

1
00:00:04,447 --> 00:00:08,255
one if you like this video and want to see more content please don't forget to

2
00:00:08,319 --> 00:00:12,607
life and subscribe so just a few details on the pattern the other mentioned is the

3
00:00:12,704 --> 00:00:18,431
friar dress in the book stretch I've made it a dress version but there's also a

4
00:00:19,135 --> 00:00:19,903
sweater version

5
00:00:21,087 --> 00:00:25,920
I will take all of the variation of having a Conor because as you can see

6
00:00:26,591 --> 00:00:31,104
so there's also a mock neck time one which I think all the other variations feature

7
00:00:31,295 --> 00:00:35,071
in the book also I made a size for think the fabric of used for this

8
00:00:35,263 --> 00:00:39,680
is actually from the fabric land in the UK so I think I got this

9
00:00:40,895 --> 00:00:44,639
is no at least a couple of his go if not more so it's been sitting

10
00:00:44,736 --> 00:00:48,256
in my stash for quite a while I was actually going to make the cocoa Drustan

11
00:00:48,319 --> 00:00:53,888
its which is quite a similar I'm person to this one and Billy and I I

12
00:00:54,048 --> 00:00:59,391
concede the hannett feature ever we would go well with this fabric its fabric so yeah

13
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:03,327
it's quite a stretching it actually and I think of it stretched too much it might

14
00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:04,000
be a bit

15
00:01:05,407 --> 00:01:10,272
transform but apart from that I really like it I think the drapes nicely

16
00:01:11,487 --> 00:01:15,615
and it's one that's really nice to lay up with type so in the book stretch

17
00:01:15,807 --> 00:01:20,863
they designed the patterns in the order of difficulties so you start off with a BB

18
00:01:20,959 --> 00:01:26,720
scare and which I've reviewed well I reviewed the pinnacle version and and there's also the

19
00:01:26,816 --> 00:01:31,807
Frankie t-shirt which I previewed as well in the past and this one's a few patterns

20
00:01:31,968 --> 00:01:36,223
on so it is a bit more challenging than those two and but I still wouldn't

21
00:01:36,255 --> 00:01:42,335
say it's it's not achievable so as mentioned it it's quite like the cocoa dress in

22
00:01:42,367 --> 00:01:43,807
the sense that it's a nice

23
00:01:45,183 --> 00:01:49,311
it's a similar shape or resee the comic is a different feature but I wouldn't say

24
00:01:49,375 --> 00:01:53,344
it's actually that difficult could you just stitch the two bits together

25
00:01:55,295 --> 00:02:00,639
and it shows on quite easily on to the neckline which I'm having a neckbands probably

26
00:02:00,671 --> 00:02:05,856
a lot more challenging than adding this helmet so no sure making some more connect funds

27
00:02:05,952 --> 00:02:10,367
father I'll have to give it go and find out I won't they mentioned in previous

28
00:02:10,432 --> 00:02:16,735
reviews on telling the buttons patterns that really nice and straightforward it's like was holding your

29
00:02:16,768 --> 00:02:20,320
hands as you go through the process so yeah it's really

30
00:02:22,272 --> 00:02:25,440
nice pattern to follow so the design and fit

31
00:02:26,751 --> 00:02:30,399
again it is similar to the cocoa dress so if you like that design you're probably

32
00:02:30,464 --> 00:02:35,136
like this Paston as well I did find it probably as short as the cocoa dress

33
00:02:35,231 --> 00:02:39,647
so that kind of gone for a sort of sixties him if that makes sense so

34
00:02:40,223 --> 00:02:45,343
and it's probably shorter than I normally like because I didn't actually length the littleness which

35
00:02:45,472 --> 00:02:50,367
normally I would I'm not sure wise in this time but saying that I think it's

36
00:02:50,432 --> 00:02:54,688
fine with types I think crossed to get you sat there abridges one where but I

37
00:02:54,751 --> 00:02:58,464
was lighter than its long sleep so I'm very likely to wear it when it's cold

38
00:02:58,815 --> 00:03:02,367
I really like this a comeback if it's a really nice long one

39
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:09,440
I think it at the really nice detail preview really nice and a playing fabric as

40
00:03:09,472 --> 00:03:13,408
well well they say that I do like to live them more connect phones now which

41
00:03:13,503 --> 00:03:19,360
I think would go really nicely with the pitiful layering up again in the winter it's

42
00:03:19,391 --> 00:03:22,720
difficult to gauge the time taken just because it had that she been a bit of

43
00:03:22,783 --> 00:03:25,792
time since I made it but I don't think it took more than a day to

44
00:03:25,856 --> 00:03:30,399
make I did wait to him low because I felt that this fabric needed to rest

45
00:03:31,039 --> 00:03:34,975
so I left it a couple of days just to settle and then I double-checked the

46
00:03:35,039 --> 00:03:40,063
him and stitched it which I'm really glad I did everyone really pleased with this dress

47
00:03:40,927 --> 00:03:45,248
it's one that I probably will only wear when it is really cold outside because I

48
00:03:45,343 --> 00:03:50,912
get hot quite easily and in Cornwall it's quite mild where we live so I don't

49
00:03:50,975 --> 00:03:54,751
often where a lot of long sleeve so in that sense it's probably not as

50
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,296
as good as some of the other person's that have made from the book discuss I

51
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:02,559
don't think I'm gonna wear it as much to say the Frankie t-shirt or the baby

52
00:04:02,656 --> 00:04:06,367
plentiful but saying that you know if you love someone that's a lot colder this was

53
00:04:06,432 --> 00:04:11,871
gonna be a lovely dress or sou'wester if you make the sweater version and yes just

54
00:04:11,904 --> 00:04:16,511
rocket warm when it's cold outside or cold inside and then we hootings like I found

55
00:04:16,575 --> 00:04:21,088
it enjoyable to make as well which is always a bonus that said the today thanks

56
00:04:21,152 --> 00:04:21,600
for watching
