today's a video is showing you how to make your own Trani cover

1
00:00:05,119 --> 00:00:08,736
now by trolley I mean one of those treaty trollies you can get them in ikea

2
00:00:08,928 --> 00:00:12,223
the one I thought is from hobby craft the one I'm making is for my mom

3
00:00:12,416 --> 00:00:15,711
and I know that she put the same one as me which is Hoby crossed and

4
00:00:15,776 --> 00:00:17,695
which is perfect because I have my want measure

5
00:00:19,392 --> 00:00:22,399
yeah if you want to make caring and I'm so free to follow along and I'll

6
00:00:22,464 --> 00:00:26,624
show you how I managed to make this one as always did you like this video

7
00:00:26,687 --> 00:00:29,568
I want to seem more don't forget to like and since right on this truly have

8
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:34,208
that it's very simple it's just one long piece that goes all the way up and

9
00:00:34,240 --> 00:00:37,215
down obviously if you don't have a piece of out a long enough you could add

10
00:00:37,599 --> 00:00:41,183
a seam at the top you just need to actual signal ants on that end and

11
00:00:41,215 --> 00:00:45,312
then I've got panel up front and a panel at the back so clearly made up

12
00:00:45,344 --> 00:00:49,535
of three pieces but then I will say got a lining again made out the three

13
00:00:49,631 --> 00:00:52,863
pieces and then the joined at the bottom and the design have gone for it is

14
00:00:53,599 --> 00:00:58,111
versatile because my one wanted one where she could potentially store or in the top chef

15
00:00:58,271 --> 00:00:58,911
if she wanted

16
00:00:59,936 --> 00:01:03,296
so it's got a tan up at the bottom and it's just give you an idea

17
00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:07,199
of what I saw in my trialling and I'm not sure what my own stores and

18
00:01:07,232 --> 00:01:10,559
hands I think she's got a couple as well I don't know which one she wants

19
00:01:10,592 --> 00:01:13,407
a cover for it in anyway so I've got lots of bread at the top of

20
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:14,527
but my snap the pastor's

21
00:01:16,064 --> 00:01:18,975
other little habitat reason I bought a random

22
00:01:20,064 --> 00:01:24,543
section of fabric said and I look like of just dropped my embroidery thread there as

23
00:01:24,575 --> 00:01:28,543
well I don't normally start on here and then at the bottom I thought all marbly

24
00:01:28,736 --> 00:01:33,311
a pocket friends so the first thing I did in odas to make the trolley other

25
00:01:33,472 --> 00:01:39,008
was to take some some measurements from this the first measurement I took was from the

26
00:01:39,071 --> 00:01:40,384
base so I took the

27
00:01:41,407 --> 00:01:43,839
depth so from here over to him

28
00:01:44,863 --> 00:01:45,632
I took the with

29
00:01:47,519 --> 00:01:53,760
between these two points and it took the height from again just where this mess of

30
00:01:53,823 --> 00:01:57,472
it awesome finishes so just above the Wilkes they didn't want to get to get in

31
00:01:57,503 --> 00:02:00,800
the way the world up and to hear but then I did had seven and half

32
00:02:00,863 --> 00:02:04,416
centimeters just in case she wanted to add a bit more a bit like I have

33
00:02:04,608 --> 00:02:08,735
it's not it's not flush to the top just so she can store a few extra

34
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:14,751
things in the top section with those three measurements of then got about to creating the

35
00:02:14,815 --> 00:02:19,679
passen pieces so this pattern that you really need to draw out to person templates and

36
00:02:19,712 --> 00:02:22,591
they're both rectangles which is great the first one you need to do is just like

37
00:02:22,656 --> 00:02:28,703
paddle so that's just over one of the wider Emmons so I guess ministate the width

38
00:02:29,727 --> 00:02:35,839
of the trolley so what I did was I took the wits measurement added two centimeters

39
00:02:35,904 --> 00:02:39,839
I had a sense AEC one-ounce either side or whatever simulant you were to use and

40
00:02:39,871 --> 00:02:40,063
then

41
00:02:41,087 --> 00:02:45,311
with the height I used the high that I wanted for the trolley cover that I

42
00:02:45,376 --> 00:02:48,895
just worked out and then added two centimeters on to that I don't want to worry

43
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:52,320
about any corners I don't know why I just thought it might look but life there

44
00:02:52,384 --> 00:02:56,447
is it was and so what I did do was I used a simple cup this

45
00:02:56,511 --> 00:03:00,800
is for my key actually and I just put it in the corner the top two

46
00:03:00,927 --> 00:03:06,688
corners to draw a curve and the light cut or then I drew that curved color

47
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:10,399
rather than keeping the end the other person please let's make worth of the other two

48
00:03:10,591 --> 00:03:15,904
sides of the truly cover and the top section so I wanted one long piece to

49
00:03:15,936 --> 00:03:20,447
go all the way over basely one side the top then the other side so for

50
00:03:20,511 --> 00:03:21,919
this I took the

51
00:03:23,167 --> 00:03:27,679
depth measurement and added two centimeters to get the width of this person least it so

52
00:03:27,807 --> 00:03:29,503
for the length of this long piece I took to

53
00:03:30,815 --> 00:03:33,600
I calculated to lots of the height plus

54
00:03:34,751 --> 00:03:34,848
the

55
00:03:35,936 --> 00:03:40,927
width of the trolley and then I added to sent to meet us to that now

56
00:03:41,055 --> 00:03:44,832
because other one he's late to paper drawing at this template I wanted to cut this

57
00:03:44,863 --> 00:03:48,255
based on the old so I then divided that number by two now there's a chance

58
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:52,639
that this might be a bit big when it gets attached to the other person peace

59
00:03:53,216 --> 00:03:55,679
but I'm going to work out like a lot to that

60
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:59,167
the first passed in peace so I thought to Elise

61
00:04:00,703 --> 00:04:01,888
as you can see Oregon pass

62
00:04:03,423 --> 00:04:04,447
where does it so much point

63
00:04:05,792 --> 00:04:10,143
so we cut to pieces of this passing please the first one for those side panels

64
00:04:10,464 --> 00:04:15,744
and as you can see there's my coat edge that I made with the cup and

65
00:04:15,776 --> 00:04:17,183
then for the really long piece

66
00:04:18,399 --> 00:04:24,287
I cut one of these all the fold if you haven't got that far break that

67
00:04:24,415 --> 00:04:27,519
long enough obviously what you could do is cut to pieces but you just need to

68
00:04:27,584 --> 00:04:29,343
add another schema land at the top edge

69
00:04:31,359 --> 00:04:32,000
there you go so

70
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:35,200
so essentially records three

71
00:04:36,287 --> 00:04:41,791
fabric pieces for the lining and three fabric pieces for the main fabric so the first

72
00:04:41,824 --> 00:04:48,032
step was to pin or peg in my case I'm using the quilting clips to attach

73
00:04:48,992 --> 00:04:49,088
the

74
00:04:50,496 --> 00:04:52,191
panel with the curved edges

75
00:04:53,247 --> 00:04:59,872
to the long narrow rectangular piece they are just working from one end

76
00:05:00,959 --> 00:05:05,984
pinning it all the way around around the curve up on that top side and then

77
00:05:06,048 --> 00:05:10,656
allow one that long piece to then be pinned to the other side so to save

78
00:05:10,752 --> 00:05:17,791
time I decided to pin both side panels to the long narrow peace straight away as

79
00:05:17,888 --> 00:05:23,488
this wouldn't affect it so I just yeah I got both sides picked on and then

80
00:05:23,584 --> 00:05:25,664
I moved to the machine to sew them in place

81
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:43,200
once the outer peace had been made I lended the same with the lining so I

82
00:05:43,328 --> 00:05:48,895
ended up with two of the truly cover shapes so what I did was I put

83
00:05:49,664 --> 00:05:56,000
one of them inside the other so that there were right sides facing and then picked

84
00:05:56,096 --> 00:05:59,455
them all around the bottom hem edge

85
00:06:00,544 --> 00:06:02,079
and picked those together

86
00:06:34,687 --> 00:06:38,752
so once I pegged the mall in place around then moved back to the sewing machine

87
00:06:39,391 --> 00:06:43,872
and stitched this in place but I left a small gap so that I could turn

88
00:06:43,967 --> 00:06:45,407
it right side out at the end

89
00:07:00,768 --> 00:07:04,895
so once I'd seen him at the bottom I then begged it out the right way

90
00:07:05,152 --> 00:07:10,239
so I found that gap where I'd left a hole in the hands so that I

91
00:07:10,335 --> 00:07:11,328
could turn it right side

92
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:18,976
and in once I'd got the right side showing I then poked the lining piece into

93
00:07:19,712 --> 00:07:21,216
the main cover peace

94
00:07:22,303 --> 00:07:26,559
ready to them topstitch my way around the whole piece

95
00:07:34,175 --> 00:07:39,264
so here is the final truly cover as you can see it fits fine impacts the

96
00:07:39,455 --> 00:07:42,687
be a little extra room head I get it tends will you fought on the top

97
00:07:42,752 --> 00:07:47,455
players I haven't got it and that overloaded at the moment that you can see of

98
00:07:47,519 --> 00:07:51,967
for extra room in case I did add more stuck on to the stop shops as

99
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:55,808
they had but one that went up to him I can just lower this turn up

100
00:07:55,936 --> 00:08:00,032
at the bottom and then it should still cover up the lower section I think if

101
00:08:00,127 --> 00:08:04,480
I knew what I was going to store on this top shelf if it was my

102
00:08:04,608 --> 00:08:06,752
own because obviously I'm given us the way to get

103
00:08:07,839 --> 00:08:12,544
time depending on what there they're going to regulae so in this truly father what I

104
00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:17,183
might do is put some popples in just to keep that turn up in place in

105
00:08:17,279 --> 00:08:21,247
staying up okay at the moment but obviously if it probably would look a bit nicer

106
00:08:21,343 --> 00:08:25,216
or if it had a couple of this will ties or luxe a pauper's just to

107
00:08:25,279 --> 00:08:28,544
keep us in place just because I am bit worried that's gonna get a bit in

108
00:08:28,575 --> 00:08:34,335
the way and perhaps though the older against it might get a bit more worn out

109
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:38,911
in a bit more prone to looking down the its own so after I stitched the

110
00:08:38,976 --> 00:08:44,192
two layers together I did find that I definitely had to catch the two sides of

111
00:08:44,223 --> 00:08:47,776
it together so the lining in the main color so it did do a tiny bit

112
00:08:47,807 --> 00:08:53,056
of hand-stitching in four corners at the top just where the curves are just because I

113
00:08:53,151 --> 00:08:58,239
found that otherwise and it would be quite hard to put on top of mutually because

114
00:08:58,304 --> 00:09:03,007
they're you'll be continually contesting with it if that makes sense because

115
00:09:04,127 --> 00:09:08,127
the PC went on the inside might be floating college was trying to find to cover

116
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:11,872
level trolley the asset is just an idea if you did want to I'm as a

117
00:09:11,935 --> 00:09:15,968
cover to your truly it just saves again dustier guests I think my mum's probably thinking

118
00:09:16,383 --> 00:09:21,504
if my niece's around that quite young it will at least such them and grabbing hold

119
00:09:21,567 --> 00:09:26,559
of lots of potentially dangerous lyceums that could be all know I don't know watching stools

120
00:09:26,624 --> 00:09:29,247
on that but I guess you know it might be a little smooth listen things in

121
00:09:29,312 --> 00:09:32,895
that war is this will be a bit more of a deterrent but also you know

122
00:09:33,088 --> 00:09:36,575
she might be storing stuff that she doesn't use white as often as I do with

123
00:09:36,671 --> 00:09:41,760
my trolley so it just means that it keeps dust-free well so you have to wash

124
00:09:41,888 --> 00:09:44,831
them cover every dime then I guess that's it for today thanks for watching
