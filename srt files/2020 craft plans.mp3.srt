hello today I'm going to go through my plans for twenty Fenty if you like this

1
00:00:04,415 --> 00:00:08,128
video and have authority please don't forget to life unsubscribe okay so I didn't think this

2
00:00:08,159 --> 00:00:12,640
will be a very long video and but basically I'm going to go through my proposed

3
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:16,927
make mine list so I'm going to do wind from January through to the end of

4
00:00:16,992 --> 00:00:20,927
December although you can do the challenge at any time you like during the yet I'm

5
00:00:20,959 --> 00:00:23,936
going to go to do some other aims I have to see it and finally I'm

6
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,096
going to explain how I'm going to track my makes the ship if you say to

7
00:00:28,159 --> 00:00:31,743
begin with I think I'll go through my make mine list so I've got a couple

8
00:00:32,063 --> 00:00:36,512
that have carried over from twenty nineteen so the two that have carried over from twenty

9
00:00:36,576 --> 00:00:40,639
nineteen is of course but you can teach at that dimensions in my twenty nineteen review

10
00:00:40,736 --> 00:00:45,951
which was my last video and I've also carried over the argentin through which again is

11
00:00:45,984 --> 00:00:49,439
something I'd really like to get done the main problem may have with the young based

12
00:00:49,472 --> 00:00:54,495
projector's I'm quite a slow Mr and crocheter so I tend to only get one project

13
00:00:54,527 --> 00:00:58,495
done it that I think I've always thought one project on I never I always seem

14
00:00:58,527 --> 00:01:02,784
to put to the on-base project down every year but make line and I only ever

15
00:01:02,880 --> 00:01:06,688
seem to achieve one of them just because I think by the time I finished the

16
00:01:06,751 --> 00:01:10,527
first project I get my start to get to the point more inland making them stuff

17
00:01:10,592 --> 00:01:13,791
for Christmas and then I just never got around to it and I was a seemed

18
00:01:13,856 --> 00:01:18,688
to be quite ambitious and to quite big projects well I say that in twenty eighteen

19
00:01:18,783 --> 00:01:24,416
I put making and its animal Irena's time and I never managed to make that will

20
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:26,655
they say that I think it's just because you have to do a loop stitch on

21
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:31,263
it which was the main issue with that project so I needed to really concentrate to

22
00:01:31,807 --> 00:01:33,120
get into that

23
00:01:34,559 --> 00:01:38,879
I needed to really concentrate to work out that stitch and then I kept putting it

24
00:01:38,975 --> 00:01:41,791
down and I'm forgetting where I was so I just need to really sit down and

25
00:01:41,823 --> 00:01:45,952
just make it one thing so other project of got on that I've got a dressing

26
00:01:46,143 --> 00:01:49,919
gown to make this year I'm really want the fabric for it I'm so we did

27
00:01:49,952 --> 00:01:51,519
have to purchase the fabric for this one actually

28
00:01:52,736 --> 00:01:57,248
and yeah that's all ready to be cut up it's all prewashed so I'll probably make

29
00:01:57,344 --> 00:02:03,711
that soonish probably in the next month fingers crossed the other fabric I purchased recently is

30
00:02:03,839 --> 00:02:07,744
for the dungarees I want to make so I'm I think I'm going to use the

31
00:02:07,807 --> 00:02:12,352
Mila dungarees pattern which I got as a Christmas gift or the birthday gift anyway I

32
00:02:12,416 --> 00:02:15,936
got it is a gift last year or about a year ago so I'd like to

33
00:02:17,055 --> 00:02:20,608
make that up at some point and again I'm you need stretched them for that so

34
00:02:20,895 --> 00:02:25,087
I bought it specifically for this project my other young based projects I mentioned that but

35
00:02:25,119 --> 00:02:28,255
the optimising through which have carried over from our sticks I just really want to get

36
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:32,671
it done and it all saving someone some possit completers I can essentially clear out one

37
00:02:32,735 --> 00:02:38,335
of these acute some McCulloch's but I mean so and I'll have more storage a any

38
00:02:38,367 --> 00:02:41,119
way like I was saying my other your place project is I'm going to make a

39
00:02:41,216 --> 00:02:46,527
short this year and for this one I'm actually quite optimistic and might get both of

40
00:02:46,559 --> 00:02:50,559
my own base projects on the sheer because and have already sorted the shore which is

41
00:02:50,656 --> 00:02:55,391
a very promising sign but we will see I'd really like to make a man's shed

42
00:02:55,455 --> 00:03:00,927
this year mainly because my partner fell he really would like a shop and I've never

43
00:03:00,992 --> 00:03:05,408
made him one before but I'm actually doing a level to award is the city good

44
00:03:05,535 --> 00:03:11,104
qualification and I'm making a woman's share in that at the moment I'm I'll show you

45
00:03:11,167 --> 00:03:16,255
the progress so feretory so please excuse I'm all the creases in a I keep shoving

46
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:21,055
it about to go to this class but yes so the fabrics from many of across

47
00:03:22,367 --> 00:03:30,175
well the last flight Africans I got some matching yellow poplin cotton fabric for the contrast

48
00:03:30,335 --> 00:03:32,608
on the yoke on the inside the cuffs

49
00:03:36,608 --> 00:03:41,184
the packet on the sleeve opening on this project I've been able to learn quite lock

50
00:03:41,248 --> 00:03:45,055
techniques are in you know I've got there are a couple of Tuck's on here

51
00:03:46,656 --> 00:03:50,656
obviously I'm having to attach a cuff this one's partially don't I still need to finish

52
00:03:50,751 --> 00:03:55,199
off the cups and by the time I finished that all of made a color and

53
00:03:55,360 --> 00:04:00,128
added the Boston band on the front step yeah it's been really interesting making this of

54
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:03,904
really enjoyed that can wait for it to be finished actually as well that's I compare

55
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,968
it so yeah the safari hopefully be the first project I finished good Leonie's finish it

56
00:04:08,031 --> 00:04:12,128
for the course I'm doing anyway so I'll give me extra motivation so I don't added

57
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:16,640
this to my make time because I'm this is obviously how barbut with the in twenty

58
00:04:16,671 --> 00:04:22,687
nineteen but I would like to make a man's shirt there you'll probably make one fulfilled

59
00:04:23,328 --> 00:04:27,519
possibly my that I'm not sure but yeah the shots Stephanie in the cards can I

60
00:04:27,584 --> 00:04:31,231
think I have the confidence after making this one for the show I'm hoping on my

61
00:04:31,359 --> 00:04:35,040
and she had some fabric at home to use I was quite like to make a

62
00:04:35,135 --> 00:04:40,096
Christmas deem shirt at some point but I would have to buy a fabric to make

63
00:04:40,191 --> 00:04:44,864
a festive unless I embroidered something in it but I don't really have any claims fabric

64
00:04:44,992 --> 00:04:49,152
to do that so I'd have to still by plane fabric that will see a gun

65
00:04:49,279 --> 00:04:53,055
mother to me on the buttons passing on their which is the fray a sweater so

66
00:04:53,279 --> 00:04:57,951
I've already made the fray a cow neck dress so it's essentially the same person from

67
00:04:58,432 --> 00:05:03,712
Tilly one spoke stretch but I'd really like to make the top version as I got

68
00:05:04,287 --> 00:05:10,528
a couple of different pinnacles now Orchy and so I'm finally wearing the tear so this

69
00:05:10,592 --> 00:05:16,191
was my upcycled one I would say have an IV pinafore which is a Jennifer Lauren

70
00:05:16,256 --> 00:05:20,511
handmade passen I will say another really nice pitiful that my sister got for me for

71
00:05:20,544 --> 00:05:25,471
my birthday last year so it's really nice to have different tops that can go under

72
00:05:25,536 --> 00:05:29,600
all of those and I think the friar quest is a really good one particularly for

73
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:33,888
the colder months recently I got a couple of holon x is a gift for Christmas

74
00:05:34,272 --> 00:05:39,104
and which is something I said I'd really like know I never like that design and

75
00:05:39,839 --> 00:05:44,864
that I feel comfortable wearing that I'm going to make some myself as well I've added

76
00:05:45,055 --> 00:05:49,824
the free person by sullen of assonance the slip of it on here just because I

77
00:05:50,015 --> 00:05:53,951
might make them as a gift and I felt like I needed to had a couple

78
00:05:54,015 --> 00:05:59,104
of gifts on to my mate line to make it a bit more untunable because what

79
00:05:59,135 --> 00:06:04,864
tends to happen is I make some stuff for myself possibly indefinitely in the first half

80
00:06:04,895 --> 00:06:08,608
of the year I can only get to about June and then I kind of trail

81
00:06:08,671 --> 00:06:12,511
off a bit I don't if it just gets a bit too warm or it's just

82
00:06:12,544 --> 00:06:17,600
because people's besting start dropping up or I start thinking of Chris man so know maybe

83
00:06:17,727 --> 00:06:22,432
other stuff's just happens at that time he anyway so I was end up kind of

84
00:06:22,623 --> 00:06:27,264
losing steam at some points and then I start shifting on to make us for other

85
00:06:27,295 --> 00:06:30,976
people so I gotta figured that if I had the old one for someone else as

86
00:06:31,007 --> 00:06:35,231
well in the make knife and might actually make more than them the final item I

87
00:06:35,424 --> 00:06:41,312
put on here is to make some trousers so I've signed up already to a local

88
00:06:41,376 --> 00:06:45,664
Patton casting course and which is to make your own trials of lock which I'm really

89
00:06:45,727 --> 00:06:50,816
excited about it is an introduction to pass in casting in twenty nineteen which I really

90
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:53,888
enjoyed so we night sky back to passing cutting and a little bit more but to

91
00:06:53,951 --> 00:06:57,536
be honest I haven't done a huge amount since I did that interaction is passing casting

92
00:06:58,144 --> 00:07:02,335
so I'm not sure if I'm jumping the gun about going straight on to the trials

93
00:07:02,399 --> 00:07:06,208
are cutting one but I will say equally hoping that it might inspire me and also

94
00:07:06,303 --> 00:07:10,623
I think it will build on that knowledge to perhaps all then real address all of

95
00:07:10,656 --> 00:07:14,239
the past in casting I've learned so far and actually experimented it more I think so

96
00:07:14,272 --> 00:07:18,559
that's my make nine I'm quite optimistic about this list actually I quite like during the

97
00:07:18,592 --> 00:07:23,552
make line list just because it kind of gives you a starting point on what to

98
00:07:23,615 --> 00:07:27,231
make I know you know different patterns come out during the year I mean I personally

99
00:07:27,264 --> 00:07:31,552
got tons of patterns in my stash as those things I just want to make on

100
00:07:31,648 --> 00:07:34,559
a whim as well you know a bit like last year when we make the beach

101
00:07:34,656 --> 00:07:37,760
top poncho that was on on my neck line we just wanted to make a beach

102
00:07:37,824 --> 00:07:41,471
towel bunching so well there any made a few of I make my last year I

103
00:07:41,567 --> 00:07:45,600
don't necessarily fill that bad about it because avise it takes to change over the year

104
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:49,407
or and your priorities change so it's not the end of the world but it's nice

105
00:07:49,503 --> 00:07:53,471
to have something to focus on particular at the start of the year so other things

106
00:07:53,631 --> 00:07:58,847
I want to focus on this year making wise I am as I mentioned I picked

107
00:07:58,911 --> 00:08:03,712
on to you in a passing casting course for making the trials of look so that's

108
00:08:03,776 --> 00:08:10,335
definitely a core goals are already signed up to it and I hope to make as

109
00:08:10,559 --> 00:08:14,432
parer trousers from that I would like to go back as I mentioned to what I've

110
00:08:14,496 --> 00:08:17,951
learned on pattern cutting the other thing I'd like to do possibly earlier on in the

111
00:08:18,015 --> 00:08:23,007
year is to get some of my garments mended so I do have a pile of

112
00:08:23,584 --> 00:08:28,799
garments and bags as well to be fair their only fixing so I've held a plentiful

113
00:08:29,312 --> 00:08:34,687
and I've got the friar pinafore which is the Kirsty Hartley person I don't know if

114
00:08:34,752 --> 00:08:38,591
it was just exclusive in the simply serving magazine and but anywhere I did a review

115
00:08:38,911 --> 00:08:43,296
quite a number of years ago now on this person I really do like this design

116
00:08:43,552 --> 00:08:47,903
and but the trouble is I use this really nice needle board from fabrics below and

117
00:08:48,192 --> 00:08:51,968
the buttons keep ripping off the back so I think I need to either put every

118
00:08:52,064 --> 00:08:58,111
enforced and bit fabric on the back that's got really think interfacing or I might even

119
00:08:58,208 --> 00:09:01,888
just put a different fabric of the back maybe a remnant of the custom poplin I've

120
00:09:01,919 --> 00:09:06,495
got there or even a thicker yellow fabric I seem to want the other fabrics and

121
00:09:06,559 --> 00:09:10,495
breathing only fabric and but yes sir I need to fix that so I can Waris

122
00:09:10,559 --> 00:09:16,255
again about a couple of ready to where garments which I'm like I've got one that

123
00:09:16,288 --> 00:09:21,408
has this bar across the front new your call again but it's come away at one

124
00:09:21,504 --> 00:09:25,375
side so I caught my that until it's fixed I've got another dress it's a knitted

125
00:09:25,471 --> 00:09:28,864
one and that one has got a couple of holes in it which I need to

126
00:09:28,927 --> 00:09:33,247
down so I would like to get all of that done and then moving forward just

127
00:09:33,312 --> 00:09:37,184
fix things as soon as they break so yes consistent mending it's definitely on the agenda

128
00:09:37,247 --> 00:09:40,992
for twenty twenty there are a couple of special birthday is coming up in twenty twenty

129
00:09:41,599 --> 00:09:45,791
and my family so I need to focus on them make sure that I get everything

130
00:09:45,888 --> 00:09:50,080
that I want to achieve that their birthdays sorted out care if I don't think I

131
00:09:50,176 --> 00:09:54,015
want to do address in this video is how I'm going to track my progress and

132
00:09:54,143 --> 00:09:58,111
more importantly my makes so what I've done I don't know if I can get this

133
00:09:58,176 --> 00:10:03,424
on the screen but I'll try to I am going to use I'm a spreadsheet to

134
00:10:03,455 --> 00:10:07,744
do that so I think about schepen on exile online but you could do this in

135
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:13,440
Google sheets or and not the spreadsheet slipware I'm sure would work I've used an online

136
00:10:13,599 --> 00:10:18,271
based spreadsheet just to that I can update it wherever I am I don't have to

137
00:10:18,335 --> 00:10:21,664
be at home on the chamisa I can look it up the quick reference on my

138
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:25,919
phone in the reason I chosen to use the spreadsheet for this is I'm quite data-driven

139
00:10:25,984 --> 00:10:30,271
and so my day job I look at a lot data and I guess that kind

140
00:10:30,304 --> 00:10:33,280
of just spilled into my personal life I guess it just nice to be able to

141
00:10:33,343 --> 00:10:37,760
track your progress I do think it helps to know how much you've achieved in the

142
00:10:37,823 --> 00:10:41,984
year so I think I'll be my main motivation because then it will show that although

143
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:46,208
you know that may be times when you can't make something or you haven't been able

144
00:10:46,239 --> 00:10:48,992
to achieve as much as you want to do but then you can look back see

145
00:10:49,119 --> 00:10:54,304
all the extra imprint two projects the have achieved anything else really that's you know have

146
00:10:54,335 --> 00:10:57,919
been added to your list and then at least you can then see how much you

147
00:10:58,015 --> 00:11:03,455
have managed to do and faculty very motivating and inspiring so on my scratchy I'm going

148
00:11:03,552 --> 00:11:08,351
to give each project a name I'm going to list which pass and I've used what

149
00:11:08,479 --> 00:11:10,432
type of product is so I

150
00:11:11,552 --> 00:11:15,935
have create a drop down this for this so I've added if it's a garment it

151
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:22,783
is the top if it's bottoms if it's a one-piece garment it is an accessory how

152
00:11:22,976 --> 00:11:26,687
so would I some a toy I've put so I can look holding it takes me

153
00:11:26,848 --> 00:11:32,288
or how long the project goes on for so I've got a column to put the

154
00:11:32,383 --> 00:11:35,679
start day on the end date and then I put a formular in to calculate the

155
00:11:35,744 --> 00:11:38,495
total number of days that took me to complete it I think I had a bit

156
00:11:38,559 --> 00:11:42,367
where I can break the project as well I don't know for added it yet but

157
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:46,304
obviously if I have all show you if I bunch to this lay on the screen

158
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:53,088
someone that as well to look whether it's for myself or someone else and whether it's

159
00:11:53,151 --> 00:11:57,280
Christmas make or not so I just don't get released would see actually how many items

160
00:11:57,375 --> 00:12:00,447
do make for myself how many I do make for other people how many I make

161
00:12:00,512 --> 00:12:04,096
for the house at the moment I feel like I want that information that it may

162
00:12:04,255 --> 00:12:07,648
turn out that the India I don't even look at it in which case or review

163
00:12:07,776 --> 00:12:12,159
how much information I really need to look so I've added a few things on their

164
00:12:12,255 --> 00:12:16,064
and then I think all review it maybe partway through the year maybe at the end

165
00:12:16,096 --> 00:12:19,744
of the year and then decide how I need to adjust the format so maybe that

166
00:12:19,807 --> 00:12:23,872
I don't want to look for type of garment I'm making or whether it's myself for

167
00:12:23,903 --> 00:12:27,679
someone else I've just thought of a few different things that I may possibly want to

168
00:12:27,776 --> 00:12:32,383
look and I'll take it from that okay so that's it for this week so hopefully

169
00:12:32,607 --> 00:12:38,271
I'll be back next time with any video possibly hopefully to do with the shirt I

170
00:12:38,335 --> 00:12:42,848
showed you like say I'm really placed to finishing it but yeah hopefully I'll get it

171
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:46,528
finished by them and then I'll be able to review the pattern x leching
