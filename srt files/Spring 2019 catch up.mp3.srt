00:00:07,455 --> 00:00:12,831
this week I thought I'd do a bit of an update so what a few projects

1
00:00:12,928 --> 00:00:18,048
on the go I've also completed quite a lot stuff that haven't yet I'm reviewed it

2
00:00:18,176 --> 00:00:22,752
all showed it in the video so I'm gonna do better preview on those although I

3
00:00:22,847 --> 00:00:28,224
will probably still do review one most of them if I haven't made them previously

4
00:00:29,568 --> 00:00:36,032
also once to a couple projects that I'm currently working on and what I've got planned

5
00:00:36,159 --> 00:00:36,703
for the future

6
00:00:38,464 --> 00:00:44,127
supporting off with the makes that I haven't yet shown and I made quite a few

7
00:00:44,256 --> 00:00:50,560
thing and since the start of the year I started off with making another so over

8
00:00:50,624 --> 00:00:53,408
at Molly dress and in the chevron fabric

9
00:00:54,911 --> 00:00:55,071
see

10
00:00:58,271 --> 00:01:04,192
when I reviewed this person I said that I wouldn't do the long-sleeved version because and

11
00:01:04,351 --> 00:01:07,968
because it's quite my old and home all that I wouldn't wear at that much by

12
00:01:08,160 --> 00:01:11,519
have actually got against that and made a long sleep version

13
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:15,040
I think main because I wanted to see what

14
00:01:16,704 --> 00:01:22,304
and the contrast would look like and however in this chevron for briquets not that obvious

15
00:01:23,167 --> 00:01:27,199
and that you have got views out there do wonder whether I should have made a

16
00:01:27,328 --> 00:01:34,463
cocoa dress instead potentially and but yeah no it's fine I didn't have trouble with the

17
00:01:34,912 --> 00:01:40,416
sleeves which was a disclaimer but on my previous review but I'm you have no happy

18
00:01:40,480 --> 00:01:40,832
with that

19
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:46,143
is also one on my make line so and that's one of the list

20
00:01:47,199 --> 00:01:48,608
the next one I made was

21
00:01:50,304 --> 00:01:55,424
frankly t-shirt and from Dylan the button stretch book so

22
00:01:56,480 --> 00:02:00,031
I've already reviewed this well as well so probably won't show it and

23
00:02:01,984 --> 00:02:07,071
I won't review it again and I've done it short sleeved as before I did adult

24
00:02:07,263 --> 00:02:12,703
pattern top previously I've used this fabric before and to make and I think it's a

25
00:02:12,768 --> 00:02:14,688
mega Nilsson briar tea

26
00:02:16,895 --> 00:02:21,343
and I had quite a lot leftover so I have just enough to make this short

27
00:02:21,376 --> 00:02:26,720
sleeve version and it goes really well under got quite a lot of the pinafores I

28
00:02:26,815 --> 00:02:29,856
have so I'm really happy with this and I warn it late

29
00:02:31,391 --> 00:02:35,839
now part of my motivation to make another Frankie t-shirt was that I wanted to make

30
00:02:35,968 --> 00:02:40,832
the baby pinafore out of the stretch book as well which is another my property so

31
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:41,472
far the ship

32
00:02:42,623 --> 00:02:42,751
so

33
00:02:46,527 --> 00:02:51,104
I've actually got the Jennifer Lauren gable top under on the hangar at the moment

34
00:02:53,376 --> 00:02:53,727
lock on it

35
00:02:55,072 --> 00:02:58,304
only a little better price but this is

36
00:02:59,583 --> 00:03:00,095
the pinafore

37
00:03:01,343 --> 00:03:06,464
I decided to make this because I was going to make dress up this fabric and

38
00:03:06,527 --> 00:03:14,720
then I accidentally caught my nans Christmas gift in this fabric instead of another quite similar

39
00:03:14,783 --> 00:03:20,416
rebred fabric so I didn't have enough to make the dress anymore however I had

40
00:03:22,656 --> 00:03:26,207
a sufficient amount left over to make this pitiful which is what I wanted to make

41
00:03:26,335 --> 00:03:32,608
anyway and and I really like the shape of this pitiful it's really nice I wasn't

42
00:03:32,671 --> 00:03:38,399
sure about making the baby Scott on its own whereas I think I probably will get

43
00:03:38,432 --> 00:03:42,591
a lot more use out of that is a plentiful with a saying that allies made

44
00:03:42,688 --> 00:03:48,800
it and I really do like the shapes it's a nice visit skirts it's this time

45
00:03:49,343 --> 00:03:49,824
Peter

46
00:03:51,039 --> 00:03:54,335
and it's just in that pays your hips that I find is the main struggle with

47
00:03:54,399 --> 00:03:59,583
this and so could make sure that your and stitchings good carrying on with the stretch

48
00:03:59,679 --> 00:04:03,839
book basically I'm going through it I made the

49
00:04:04,927 --> 00:04:10,399
fray address so as soon as I saw this pattern I feel I've got this hour

50
00:04:10,464 --> 00:04:15,871
fabric from fabric lands which I've had for a while I can't actually remember why was

51
00:04:15,936 --> 00:04:19,743
it for it was for a project but I think I just decided to scrap that

52
00:04:19,967 --> 00:04:25,984
I wanted to make the konak version of the progress and again really happy with how

53
00:04:26,111 --> 00:04:26,783
it turned out

54
00:04:27,839 --> 00:04:30,239
I haven't reviewed it yet but I plan to

55
00:04:31,359 --> 00:04:37,023
I really like the konak vergine actually I might try one of the other versions I

56
00:04:37,152 --> 00:04:40,799
am equally I just be happy to make another qanat version

57
00:04:43,584 --> 00:04:48,608
I did find it it's quite short and me and there I guess normally I would

58
00:04:48,959 --> 00:04:51,167
lengthen it a bit but I mean it's fine with type

59
00:04:52,191 --> 00:04:52,864
this is

60
00:04:54,528 --> 00:04:56,575
the from Wendy woods book

61
00:04:58,175 --> 00:04:58,976
when they would book

62
00:05:00,511 --> 00:05:06,623
the beginners guide to you saying with knitted fabric so and my part I got me

63
00:05:06,687 --> 00:05:11,167
this book I got me the stretch book as well but all me and Wendy woods

64
00:05:11,231 --> 00:05:17,855
book first I'm basically a year on I'm finally getting around to doing through these books

65
00:05:18,528 --> 00:05:22,783
and as soon as I saw the kinda cardigan I wanted to make a yellow version

66
00:05:22,976 --> 00:05:25,727
so and before I stopped buying fabric

67
00:05:27,584 --> 00:05:33,567
in December I think this was my last fabric purchase I bought this yellow fabric for

68
00:05:33,631 --> 00:05:36,864
the sole purpose of making the skin the cart kinda card again

69
00:05:38,079 --> 00:05:42,528
and Prue can't see it that well here and as you might native I've just come

70
00:05:42,592 --> 00:05:46,335
back from the gym so I don't really want to put it over and this top

71
00:05:48,864 --> 00:05:54,592
yeah so I made one for my Nan so Christmas and which probably got a photo

72
00:05:54,656 --> 00:05:59,104
that I can share when I do the review and I really liked the design I

73
00:05:59,135 --> 00:06:03,839
was always tempted to go for and I did the midlength so it kind of ampoules

74
00:06:03,936 --> 00:06:08,799
just blew hips so I was tempted to make that one after seeing it but my

75
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:13,631
gut reaction when I first saw the passing was to make the long version am and

76
00:06:13,664 --> 00:06:15,743
I'm really peace but from that

77
00:06:17,023 --> 00:06:21,343
I'm see I'm really happy with this make think I'll get quite a lot you said

78
00:06:21,407 --> 00:06:26,303
it over spring when you get to that in between the weather when it sells to

79
00:06:26,335 --> 00:06:26,720
warm up

80
00:06:27,872 --> 00:06:30,111
and and their final make

81
00:06:31,615 --> 00:06:32,511
I have made recently

82
00:06:34,944 --> 00:06:37,791
is this the over it cold dress

83
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:42,656
and so I got this person I think the first time we did the PDF when

84
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:44,959
you get and the one included

85
00:06:46,623 --> 00:06:53,279
I believe that when I acquired it and yes so um it's very straightforward person again

86
00:06:53,376 --> 00:07:00,384
the whole do were a review later and do you find that it looks better if

87
00:07:00,447 --> 00:07:01,312
you put a house on

88
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:03,712
and although

89
00:07:05,471 --> 00:07:09,888
I have found that I do have a rubberless way back so that might be why

90
00:07:10,335 --> 00:07:10,496
it

91
00:07:11,648 --> 00:07:16,320
doesn't necessarily shake them well on me and particular at the back but

92
00:07:17,727 --> 00:07:21,888
yeah so that's another make and using up a bit more by Sasha's again I've had

93
00:07:21,984 --> 00:07:26,239
this fabric and there's quite a long time right do that

94
00:07:27,359 --> 00:07:32,735
whistle-stop tour of the mix I've made recently and so I've got a few things in

95
00:07:32,799 --> 00:07:39,007
progress as well I'm making the journey dress out the sketchbook the base like day working

96
00:07:39,167 --> 00:07:43,519
my way through the persons in that book I've got

97
00:07:47,424 --> 00:07:48,223
this fabric

98
00:07:50,432 --> 00:07:53,920
it's this paper it to which I'm using for the journey dress

99
00:07:56,895 --> 00:07:58,752
which again is for my stash

100
00:08:01,664 --> 00:08:05,920
so I do have a stroke fabric I'd like to make it in as well but

101
00:08:06,175 --> 00:08:08,832
I'd like to do a trial run on a

102
00:08:10,079 --> 00:08:12,768
less completed fabric before I go for the stripes

103
00:08:15,135 --> 00:08:15,391
what

104
00:08:17,696 --> 00:08:18,623
I have had this I'm

105
00:08:19,679 --> 00:08:25,888
unfinished for ages and in some also making the Bridgetown dress I think I saw to

106
00:08:25,951 --> 00:08:26,208
that

107
00:08:27,679 --> 00:08:28,575
nearly a year ago

108
00:08:29,951 --> 00:08:32,799
being on my I'm dressed for most of the year

109
00:08:34,047 --> 00:08:34,176
so

110
00:08:35,231 --> 00:08:39,872
basically again I think I got this and fabric from a charity shop actually but it's

111
00:08:40,127 --> 00:08:44,768
been my stash for a bit so essentially I have

112
00:08:46,015 --> 00:08:51,552
some pretty much all but together I think I'm currently on I'm going down the bottom

113
00:08:51,616 --> 00:08:53,056
packet and the neckline

114
00:08:54,111 --> 00:08:55,072
but at the time

115
00:08:56,288 --> 00:09:00,000
I found it didn't fit that right round my bust

116
00:09:01,216 --> 00:09:05,664
all day when I tried it on near a Christmas it was fine so I don't

117
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:10,495
know whether it's just that and we had a really hot somewhere in the UK last

118
00:09:10,528 --> 00:09:17,119
year so maybe it was to do that because I won't say necessarily my weight fluctuated

119
00:09:17,408 --> 00:09:17,599
but

120
00:09:20,255 --> 00:09:24,320
I think that there's not much of am given the person already

121
00:09:25,375 --> 00:09:29,984
so I thought the heads up really just make sure you really good with your measurements

122
00:09:30,239 --> 00:09:32,927
when you see the straps and and

123
00:09:34,656 --> 00:09:40,159
their minds that there's lessees than other patterns see yeah I think it does fig and

124
00:09:40,192 --> 00:09:41,695
now I'll probably have to try again before

125
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:47,328
and put it back on the same machine but um yeah I would like to get

126
00:09:47,359 --> 00:09:51,168
this done since I think we're starting to get to the weather where it will be

127
00:09:51,263 --> 00:09:55,104
really nice to wear be nice to where with the kids the card again so and

128
00:09:55,744 --> 00:09:58,208
you see if I can get that done before Nimi thing

129
00:09:59,711 --> 00:10:01,791
I'm also during a fruit slk

130
00:10:03,135 --> 00:10:07,872
well I've got four to make some I've got a custom order on Etsy so and

131
00:10:08,895 --> 00:10:13,151
anyone he doesn't know I have a small etsi shop so I just do a few

132
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:19,776
things I do I'm like string backs croche it once and knitted fruit socks and and

133
00:10:19,807 --> 00:10:25,184
tote bags and I do have a bath but a bath hat PDF pattern as well

134
00:10:25,952 --> 00:10:28,159
and yet so this is the first

135
00:10:29,952 --> 00:10:30,911
this is the first

136
00:10:35,935 --> 00:10:40,992
this is the first fruit sock them out of the former I'm making so making all

137
00:10:41,056 --> 00:10:45,695
in this sort of royal blue color and essentially belted on the round

138
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:50,015
and its in rib stitch

139
00:10:51,104 --> 00:10:56,064
some currently fixing on that so that I can get it sent out on times and

140
00:10:56,127 --> 00:11:02,752
bow also and raced to the have actually been focusing on making this pattern which is

141
00:11:03,072 --> 00:11:11,455
a copy cardigan this is from my month missing collections and so she made this when

142
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:16,192
she was younger and she's also making one of the name is actually in a I'm

143
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:16,640
in a blue

144
00:11:18,304 --> 00:11:23,744
and so I got better copy he'd just because I find it easier to highlight the

145
00:11:24,223 --> 00:11:29,695
hussam size of using I was a didn't like rolling the original I'm so it is

146
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:33,952
by and you know I can be a bit or careless with the unpotable Pete version

147
00:11:34,943 --> 00:11:41,216
so on that I'm quite slow progress they have for me started in January and I've

148
00:11:41,312 --> 00:11:41,919
listed the back

149
00:11:43,648 --> 00:11:49,984
I'm also using black so it's quite challenging and when the light levels below and to

150
00:11:50,304 --> 00:11:51,039
see it clearly

151
00:11:52,096 --> 00:11:53,343
and at the moment

152
00:11:54,719 --> 00:12:00,416
I am on one of the first side front so

153
00:12:01,823 --> 00:12:06,208
this is it so far I am so there's an option to listen pockets at the

154
00:12:06,271 --> 00:12:08,831
front and which of course I've added

155
00:12:10,239 --> 00:12:13,728
always had it have a pocket it is one on each front side so what you

156
00:12:13,823 --> 00:12:15,424
do is you let the

157
00:12:16,864 --> 00:12:21,695
back part of the pocket one separate need also must think of so got one for

158
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:22,528
the other side

159
00:12:32,127 --> 00:12:36,927
so I dismiss it these on different needles rather than I am putting them on to

160
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:37,023
you

161
00:12:38,848 --> 00:12:42,400
I am a spare he do after without so that's how I started with the

162
00:12:44,127 --> 00:12:47,231
pocket back so I've inserted one on this side

163
00:12:48,575 --> 00:12:53,695
and as you can see scene and attach it and there is a pocket for

164
00:12:54,943 --> 00:12:58,528
and in the end will do they'll pick up these stitches which are currently held by

165
00:12:58,656 --> 00:13:04,799
this Bojan and I'll do a low and it's like a few years of rip stitch

166
00:13:05,151 --> 00:13:08,288
and then that some sewn-on I decide to secure it

167
00:13:10,111 --> 00:13:13,791
so I'm just currently going up and getting to the part where it's gonna get that

168
00:13:13,919 --> 00:13:19,711
complicated and you have to start shaping firstly for the and sleeve but you've also got

169
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:27,263
to shape for the front opening as well and you should notice it's a Ragland

170
00:13:28,351 --> 00:13:32,736
sleeved cardigan's it means the fits really nice at the end but it does mean that

171
00:13:32,927 --> 00:13:39,552
you've got to be extra vigilant and happening concentration and so

172
00:13:40,864 --> 00:13:45,280
I've already made one of these before it was the best ever of a garment that

173
00:13:45,791 --> 00:13:46,080
made

174
00:13:47,552 --> 00:13:47,968
nesting

175
00:13:49,471 --> 00:13:50,624
that was quite a few years ago

176
00:13:52,064 --> 00:13:55,872
but I've had this and wall for quite a long time I think it's just king

177
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:01,343
Cole haze and by there would be really nice to have a best tall black version

178
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:06,687
of the cards again am and that basically where the house come from so I'm hoping

179
00:14:06,783 --> 00:14:09,536
I can get this done this year is part of my neckline

180
00:14:11,616 --> 00:14:15,679
so yet on pause while I get the fruit socks done but I will be back

181
00:14:15,776 --> 00:14:20,447
nesting it soon I've got a few plans on the gap the moment I

182
00:14:21,728 --> 00:14:25,567
there a couple birthdays coming up in my family so I got really say much about

183
00:14:25,664 --> 00:14:31,200
that in case they do watch but I need to fix on those next and as

184
00:14:31,263 --> 00:14:33,536
I mentioned before I'm gonna make the journey dress

185
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:40,320
I'm gonna have to check about the fitting because I'm not now that I know what

186
00:14:40,383 --> 00:14:44,288
but this way back I'm not sure whether you can make much of an adjustment for

187
00:14:44,351 --> 00:14:48,127
that in it that broke so I'm going to do but research now before I cut

188
00:14:48,192 --> 00:14:55,583
it out I started making a passion for an apron so I've got it all digitized

189
00:14:55,744 --> 00:14:59,392
I just need to add some markings on to that and write out the instructions

190
00:15:00,831 --> 00:15:03,200
so hopefully I'll get that done as well

191
00:15:04,992 --> 00:15:10,304
so the reason I'm doing this video of this week is I'm also to mention that

192
00:15:10,335 --> 00:15:15,455
I'm doing the hundred-day project so my challenge I think the hashtag is a hundred days

193
00:15:15,552 --> 00:15:16,960
of developing content so

194
00:15:18,304 --> 00:15:22,591
like a mentioned I've made fire few things but I haven't actually got around to showering

195
00:15:22,656 --> 00:15:30,176
them so I'm fixing on developing content so it does also include I'm making item so

196
00:15:30,239 --> 00:15:35,039
that can be I'm the achievement of the day but it's also with the driver of

197
00:15:35,104 --> 00:15:37,471
consistently pasting videos and blocks

198
00:15:39,263 --> 00:15:45,471
also I've been doing some passing casting so I've been going to a local workshop and

199
00:15:45,760 --> 00:15:51,744
over the last few weeks which has been really interesting so just them learning a bit

200
00:15:51,807 --> 00:15:56,255
more up fit which is why I now know that I will be this way back

201
00:15:56,895 --> 00:16:05,151
and also here just looking at the fit in general also looking at how patterns are

202
00:16:05,216 --> 00:16:12,159
constructed from the platform so been looking at that manipulation think we're going to look at

203
00:16:12,223 --> 00:16:16,927
this set and arm homes and that so I am that's been taking up a bit

204
00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:23,583
of my time also been looking at some of the old books that I required from

205
00:16:23,903 --> 00:16:30,080
charity shops and second hand bookshop's and to reinforce what I've been learning their and yeah

206
00:16:30,304 --> 00:16:35,039
so basically and I want to do past cutting for a while but being based in

207
00:16:35,135 --> 00:16:39,520
call was a bit of a challenge though I think the closest place I could find

208
00:16:39,583 --> 00:16:44,479
somewhere was plumber and before a local workshop became available

209
00:16:46,143 --> 00:16:51,359
yeah the ways it's Bristol in London so am really fortunate that that did come up

210
00:16:51,487 --> 00:16:55,296
when it did and it was one of my goals this year is that I would

211
00:16:55,392 --> 00:17:00,416
like to be able to create Oakley at least one and design of my own

212
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:07,904
I'm which yeah I feel like I'm now gaining the knowledge to do that I mean

213
00:17:07,968 --> 00:17:12,927
you can look just look at vexes well but I quite I find that going to

214
00:17:13,343 --> 00:17:15,936
a class helps you and helps

215
00:17:18,463 --> 00:17:23,391
helps get the full rolling so you're dedicating that specified amount of time you've got someone

216
00:17:23,456 --> 00:17:24,703
there to ask questions

217
00:17:26,176 --> 00:17:30,079
and yeah then you can kind of take it from this so I think after that

218
00:17:30,176 --> 00:17:34,527
I'll have the motivation to carry on with it Oh another make that I'd like to

219
00:17:34,592 --> 00:17:39,104
do soon so I'm also be doing for just making that but I'm I got a

220
00:17:39,744 --> 00:17:44,767
I don't I'm happy that my mom got I think from a charity job so

221
00:17:46,176 --> 00:17:46,880
it's just

222
00:17:51,232 --> 00:17:53,183
so she got this before night five

223
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:58,336
and it's just my small um it's quite a small puffy

224
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:04,800
and I want to cut the less so I think basically my mum went I haven't

225
00:18:05,823 --> 00:18:11,583
I haven't unrecovered it yet do you want to do it and keep it so I

226
00:18:11,712 --> 00:18:15,712
probably get rid of this land around it I might just make a cover to go

227
00:18:15,904 --> 00:18:22,047
over this rather than unpicking and getting rid of the original cover and as I didn't

228
00:18:22,079 --> 00:18:24,447
know what it looks like on the inside it might be fine

229
00:18:25,536 --> 00:18:28,927
but it might be worth keeping and the original cover

230
00:18:30,495 --> 00:18:31,391
so for this

231
00:18:35,104 --> 00:18:39,456
she would believe me this bit of course which and she will pick up from the

232
00:18:39,488 --> 00:18:39,968
shed shop

233
00:18:42,015 --> 00:18:46,432
for seventy five p for about three meters according to the tack

234
00:18:50,239 --> 00:18:50,943
she also

235
00:18:52,608 --> 00:18:57,536
this I'm very gently fabric which instantly I don't think you can see

236
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:06,303
not quite I'm basically she made a room divider I'm using this fabric which again is

237
00:19:06,368 --> 00:19:11,040
from a charity shop so I was thinking to playing this around the edges of it

238
00:19:13,024 --> 00:19:18,079
using that I like I'm using the cords like this better quartz being used currently

239
00:19:20,832 --> 00:19:23,839
using this remnant from address that made last summer

240
00:19:25,536 --> 00:19:26,015
tundras

241
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:28,800
and to go on the top section

242
00:19:30,112 --> 00:19:30,848
and finally

243
00:19:33,312 --> 00:19:37,472
I'm going to come out this cat from another remnant which this used to be a

244
00:19:37,536 --> 00:19:43,647
casten that my mom had I'm hanging up to years ago one of the kids in

245
00:19:43,744 --> 00:19:48,640
our house and and I've used most of the fabric to covered the privy that we

246
00:19:48,735 --> 00:19:52,991
currently is in our lunch and which I'm keeping and by thought then it will tie

247
00:19:53,151 --> 00:19:59,423
in nicely with the other professor hoping for that's gone top so not completely sure the

248
00:19:59,712 --> 00:20:04,287
fabrics don't clash but hopefully and it will look fine

249
00:20:05,375 --> 00:20:07,296
so I would like to get on with that

250
00:20:09,984 --> 00:20:14,432
but I just have to see I'm the final thing to mention is I'm working with

251
00:20:14,527 --> 00:20:21,631
the next sex solution so phoenix text Aleutians and currently host my website and they also

252
00:20:21,791 --> 00:20:27,520
redesigned it and if you've seen it I am but also I am I've got a

253
00:20:27,776 --> 00:20:28,991
sewing related app

254
00:20:30,271 --> 00:20:38,015
idea which I was interested in pursuing so currently got them having look at how to

255
00:20:38,112 --> 00:20:43,264
make for our reality and so actually if you have a look at that Instagram account

256
00:20:43,296 --> 00:20:47,167
you'll see that that's the hundred day projects a thing it's a hundred Dave hundred days

257
00:20:47,359 --> 00:20:51,904
of app development so there looking at my up but also

258
00:20:53,119 --> 00:20:57,984
practicing by designing a couple of other apps at the same time and so if you

259
00:20:58,047 --> 00:21:02,719
want to have a look at that I'm a link in the description below that's it

260
00:21:02,816 --> 00:21:07,391
for now I'm Sophia hopefully I'll get on with reviewing some of these mix I'm in

261
00:21:07,488 --> 00:21:11,359
a bit more detail and but until next time thank for watching
