hello today I'm reviewing the Breton tea from the great British sewing be book from stitch

1
00:00:05,888 --> 00:00:09,503
to style as always if you like this video would like to see more like this

2
00:00:09,631 --> 00:00:14,303
please don't forget to like unsubscribe if you haven't already so the yellow someone wearing today

3
00:00:14,592 --> 00:00:18,879
is the Breton tea as I mentioned it's from this book from the stitch to style

4
00:00:19,488 --> 00:00:24,351
one of several great British sewing the books and a novel nyo

5
00:00:25,695 --> 00:00:25,823
so

6
00:00:27,040 --> 00:00:32,223
it's from the base pass in the Breton top so there's a long sleeved version of

7
00:00:32,287 --> 00:00:38,240
this essentially it's pretty much the same as this but you have an additional sleeve peace

8
00:00:38,368 --> 00:00:38,976
that you attach

9
00:00:40,287 --> 00:00:40,383
so

10
00:00:41,791 --> 00:00:47,551
I fancied making the short-sleeve version as I've mentioned many times it's quite mild down here

11
00:00:47,616 --> 00:00:52,543
in Carmel so I thought I'd do a short-sleeved copy and I quite like the look

12
00:00:52,639 --> 00:00:53,855
of the short steel of one as well

13
00:00:55,136 --> 00:00:57,312
it's got grown sleeves as you can see

14
00:00:58,431 --> 00:01:03,807
so the side I made I'm pretty sure it's the size twelve and I found that

15
00:01:03,903 --> 00:01:09,087
the sizing was quite generous so I went with that rather than my usual size fourteen

16
00:01:09,311 --> 00:01:15,008
moving on to the fabric so I've used a lemony yellow I guess you'd call it

17
00:01:15,071 --> 00:01:22,816
a fabric it is straightforward it feels like a cotton net fabric I'm not entirely sure

18
00:01:22,847 --> 00:01:25,632
where I got it from now it's been my stash for a while

19
00:01:26,783 --> 00:01:33,087
I'd say it it doesn't feel brilliant quality and it definitely doesn't have any lasting in

20
00:01:33,152 --> 00:01:39,615
it so I'm not sure how long his top is going to survive it it doesn't

21
00:01:39,648 --> 00:01:44,447
feel like it will recover it stretches and I am a bit concerned that it's gradually

22
00:01:44,512 --> 00:01:46,400
going to stretch not even like

23
00:01:47,872 --> 00:01:50,304
this way I think it's going to horizontally stretch

24
00:01:51,328 --> 00:01:52,351
and but anyway so

25
00:01:53,791 --> 00:01:58,975
the fabric wasn't the best I mean saying that you know it's been a good me

26
00:01:59,071 --> 00:02:03,071
to try out this person and see whether I like it or not so I guess

27
00:02:03,199 --> 00:02:10,367
that helps in terms of difficulty I think this is a fairly straightforward passen and if

28
00:02:10,432 --> 00:02:14,527
you're confident with nets that is the main thing I'd say which is a bit different

29
00:02:14,623 --> 00:02:21,951
to pass some other knit patterns is that it's a simple I think yes the facing

30
00:02:22,048 --> 00:02:27,712
on the top so so basically there are four pattern pieces for this variation you've got

31
00:02:27,744 --> 00:02:32,800
the front peace you've put the back peace and then you've got to the front facing

32
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:35,583
and the back to so so rather than

33
00:02:37,119 --> 00:02:40,192
a passing where you put and neck Bandon

34
00:02:41,248 --> 00:02:43,968
you're just putting a facing on a bit like you do with a lot of wave

35
00:02:44,063 --> 00:02:51,039
and base persons so in that sense am it's not too difficult however another difference with

36
00:02:51,104 --> 00:02:54,688
it to other ones is its but this really nice feature where it's the little slip

37
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:57,376
it's a little slit in the side seam

38
00:02:59,455 --> 00:03:00,703
and it's really nice feature

39
00:03:01,824 --> 00:03:06,880
so I guess if you've started sewing with nets and you want to add a few

40
00:03:06,975 --> 00:03:12,192
more skills to your repertoire it's quite a good person and but yet it's slightly fiddly

41
00:03:12,255 --> 00:03:19,328
doing the little sideslipped but not to of passing the clarity of instructions I found them

42
00:03:19,423 --> 00:03:24,192
pretty straightforward so for this pattern you just followed the same for the Breton top you

43
00:03:24,287 --> 00:03:29,311
just admit the step which I think something like step seven which is attaching the sleeve

44
00:03:30,272 --> 00:03:31,104
peace onto

45
00:03:32,576 --> 00:03:38,720
the main pieces I found both the illustrations and the written instructions helpful and easy to

46
00:03:38,783 --> 00:03:43,904
follow their as I meant in there aren't too many steps to this for design and

47
00:03:44,031 --> 00:03:49,440
fit I'm still on the pencil this one to be honest I'm not entirely convinced I

48
00:03:49,632 --> 00:03:52,063
like the neckline so it's quite a wide

49
00:03:53,248 --> 00:03:54,111
net line on this

50
00:03:55,231 --> 00:04:00,223
and again it might be just the fabric hissing I'm just worried it's going to gradually

51
00:04:00,287 --> 00:04:03,231
stretch out and drop off one shoulder

52
00:04:04,287 --> 00:04:07,264
this is something I should have done with this particular

53
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:13,632
garment is maybe add something to stop the next line stretching out quite so much so

54
00:04:13,759 --> 00:04:19,071
I have but some stay tape which is stitched I think from the neckline to about

55
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:24,256
there on the shoulder seams however I probably did need something with a slight more give

56
00:04:24,735 --> 00:04:30,335
select the stretching its day tape equivalent I could have done without all the way around

57
00:04:30,368 --> 00:04:33,824
the neck because I am concerned that it's going to gradually stretch out shape

58
00:04:35,552 --> 00:04:40,320
apart from that I think it's quite a nice length normally I prevent him quite long

59
00:04:41,119 --> 00:04:45,055
talks but I think this one is quite good when you don't want to talk to

60
00:04:45,119 --> 00:04:49,023
be quite so long for example when you're wearing it with a card again or a

61
00:04:49,119 --> 00:04:54,463
jumper and it's nice that the length of this one will actually sit with in

62
00:04:55,648 --> 00:05:00,160
the length of the jumper regarda as I got a lot tops they're just fall below

63
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:06,752
the cart in length and I do like the little and side seam slips as well

64
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:13,279
which is a nice extra little design feature the time taken this is achievable within a

65
00:05:13,343 --> 00:05:19,615
day quite easily so to complete I probably won't make this pattern again it's funny because

66
00:05:19,679 --> 00:05:22,752
I was really tempted to make the dress hack version as well but now that I've

67
00:05:22,847 --> 00:05:27,648
made it I'm not convinced that I'm that fond of this neckline even if I did

68
00:05:27,712 --> 00:05:31,743
make it in a fabric with a lasting in it so that it recovered a lot

69
00:05:31,776 --> 00:05:36,351
better and I put in some missions to make sure that it didn't stretch out too

70
00:05:36,447 --> 00:05:36,640
much

71
00:05:37,727 --> 00:05:43,135
I think comparably more likely to make another one of say the money dress by so

72
00:05:43,264 --> 00:05:43,712
over it

73
00:05:45,216 --> 00:05:49,279
but yeah probably won't make this one again although I do you think a lot of

74
00:05:49,503 --> 00:05:54,368
the issues I have with it is because I've chosen a fabric which may have not

75
00:05:54,432 --> 00:05:57,696
been best suited for it so that set for today thanks for watching
