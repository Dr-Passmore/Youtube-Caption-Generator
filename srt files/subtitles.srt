hello today I am going to show you how to sew your own wheat warmer so

1
00:00:03,680 --> 00:00:07,872
I had some lovely leftover fleece from making one of my niece's a leopard print cape

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,447
last Christmas and I decided that it would be a great opportunity to make some lavender

3
00:00:12,512 --> 00:00:16,351
wheat warmers for myself and others I find wheat warmers are really useful when you feel

4
00:00:16,416 --> 00:00:21,568
a bit sorrel stiff and I had been using a very old shop-bought one for years

5
00:00:21,631 --> 00:00:26,048
to manage my chronic health symptoms before getting around to making this one once you've made

6
00:00:26,111 --> 00:00:28,672
it all you need to do is pop it in the Mike wave for about a

7
00:00:28,704 --> 00:00:33,664
hundred twenty seconds or less if it's eight hundred what's or to a hundred seconds if

8
00:00:33,728 --> 00:00:38,655
your microwave is more than that it can help to put a small mug filled with

9
00:00:38,720 --> 00:00:42,080
water of the microwave at the same time just to provide a bit of moisture so

10
00:00:42,335 --> 00:00:47,583
what you need I used a forty five by twenty nine centimeter piece of fleece so

11
00:00:47,647 --> 00:00:52,223
that's roughly eighteen by eleven and a half inches to make this week warmer and that's

12
00:00:52,352 --> 00:00:58,527
for a traditional next style one I used seven hundred fifty grams of dried wheat and

13
00:00:58,687 --> 00:01:02,847
a couple of tablespoons of dried lavender in addition to the usual sewing items you will

14
00:01:02,911 --> 00:01:07,487
need a funnel or something similar to fill the warmer with wheat in this case I

15
00:01:07,615 --> 00:01:12,671
actually used a cardboard tube from a toilet roll because I can find a fun him

16
00:01:12,959 --> 00:01:17,120
as well as using a bowl and scales to mix the dry ingredients so the first

17
00:01:17,152 --> 00:01:22,816
step is to fold your fabric in half lengthways right sides together so that the long

18
00:01:22,879 --> 00:01:28,223
ends meet with a one centimeter or half-inch seam allowance stitch around the three open sides

19
00:01:28,736 --> 00:01:32,512
leaving a gap at one of the shore ends the turning right side out and stuffing

20
00:01:58,655 --> 00:02:00,991
trim the corners slightly and turned right side out

21
00:02:16,576 --> 00:02:19,807
with a few pins mark a line in the middle of the wheat warmer which is

22
00:02:19,904 --> 00:02:25,184
parallel to the long side of the warmer you may find it's easier to take this

23
00:02:25,279 --> 00:02:30,399
as well just because it can leave a bit warrior stitching stitch along the mark line

24
00:02:30,751 --> 00:02:35,136
starting and ending about seven and a half centimeters or three inches from the short ends

25
00:02:35,231 --> 00:02:35,712
of the warmer

26
00:02:51,104 --> 00:02:56,160
next mix around seven hundred fifty grams of weight with two tablespoons of dried lavender in

27
00:02:56,223 --> 00:02:56,479
a bowl

28
00:03:05,408 --> 00:03:09,311
using a funnel in spoon or in my case the chief in a toilet rock gradually

29
00:03:09,408 --> 00:03:10,783
filled the warmer with the mix

30
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:14,688
let's stitch the opening closed

31
00:03:22,591 --> 00:03:26,304
and there you have it a completed wheat warmer so there's lots of variations you could

32
00:03:26,399 --> 00:03:29,727
do you could bury the size and shape depending on how you wish to use the

33
00:03:29,792 --> 00:03:34,240
warmer you might want to make a circular or thinner just remember that you'll need to

34
00:03:34,464 --> 00:03:39,391
scale the amount of dry ingredients and you don't want to overstuff it these instructions include

35
00:03:39,488 --> 00:03:42,591
a line of static in the middle for the length of the warmer but you could

36
00:03:42,688 --> 00:03:46,975
leave this step out or otherwise you could go the other way and add a couple

37
00:03:47,039 --> 00:03:51,871
more lines to help shape it further ultimately it just depends how you want to use

38
00:03:51,968 --> 00:03:55,871
the wheat warmer and again you just need to make sure that you adjust the amount

39
00:03:55,904 --> 00:03:59,136
of filling that you require that's it for this time thanks for watching
