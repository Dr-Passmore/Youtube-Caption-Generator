hello today I'm reviewing the Molly dress the Molly dress is part of the ebook my

1
00:00:13,536 --> 00:00:19,871
capsule wardrobe which you can buy off the so over at website I got my version

2
00:00:20,096 --> 00:00:20,767
from the

3
00:00:22,208 --> 00:00:28,384
crofter noon magazine which was published by Molly makes for comic relief last year and which

4
00:00:28,447 --> 00:00:34,335
was twenty seventeen so as you can see I've gone for the dress variation the person

5
00:00:34,431 --> 00:00:41,344
has boast addressing the top version I've also decided to admit the sleeve pieces so you

6
00:00:41,472 --> 00:00:47,167
can add some sleeves to make a longer length however I'm as I live in quite

7
00:00:47,231 --> 00:00:51,520
a mild area I thought I'm not really gonna have much use to use the long

8
00:00:51,616 --> 00:00:55,743
sleeves and I'll just get too hot and not wear it that much so I've decided

9
00:00:55,807 --> 00:01:01,759
to go without as it already has this sloped and sleeve option as part of the

10
00:01:01,824 --> 00:01:03,263
main pattern pieces

11
00:01:04,575 --> 00:01:06,912
the size I've made is the size twelve as well

12
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:14,592
the fabric I've used is quite a thick net fabric I got it from a shop

13
00:01:14,912 --> 00:01:16,384
I came across in Hong Kong

14
00:01:18,239 --> 00:01:18,751
and

15
00:01:19,903 --> 00:01:25,087
I've got to say it did wash up nicely and it has worked fine on here

16
00:01:25,216 --> 00:01:29,568
it is quite a thick so you know it will be lovely for the winter or

17
00:01:29,632 --> 00:01:33,664
they saying that I have Warner and it is you know I wore in may and

18
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:34,559
it was fine

19
00:01:35,839 --> 00:01:42,015
difficulty and I didn't find this person too difficult as with all nuts you have to

20
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:47,552
be careful so I use things such as I'm walking fit to make sure that it

21
00:01:47,648 --> 00:01:54,176
evenly distributed I did find actually that my overlocker struggled with it I tried to adjust

22
00:01:54,431 --> 00:01:56,447
the differential seeds and try and

23
00:01:57,984 --> 00:02:02,367
make sure that it did feed through the same by found that it was quite challenging

24
00:02:02,431 --> 00:02:06,783
and I ended up taking a lot of it on the sewing machine before putting it

25
00:02:06,879 --> 00:02:11,968
through the overlocker and it hasn't made too much of a difference on the side but

26
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:12,992
you can see where it has

27
00:02:14,016 --> 00:02:18,048
Mr lined a bit it could just be my stitching most but I think that is

28
00:02:18,175 --> 00:02:22,912
because it's such a thick fabric is quite hard to make sure it evenly fit fed

29
00:02:23,007 --> 00:02:24,255
through the overlocker

30
00:02:26,815 --> 00:02:30,848
apart and that those the difficulty I say it's really simple because there aren't

31
00:02:31,936 --> 00:02:38,559
many and seems that you need to sew up the neckbands and could have posed a

32
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:43,712
bit of an issue I almost did the wrong seam allowance omitted one half centimeters but

33
00:02:43,776 --> 00:02:48,063
it's actually once and to meter and seam allowance when you attaches

34
00:02:49,184 --> 00:02:54,016
but I found that fine to attach I didn't even need to adjust it although there

35
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:57,664
is a note in the instruction saying that you may need to and cut it down

36
00:02:57,759 --> 00:03:02,623
or extend it depending on your fabric in terms of the clarity of the instructions I

37
00:03:02,783 --> 00:03:09,087
found that it was very straightforward and clear I can't think of any point in the

38
00:03:09,184 --> 00:03:13,727
person where I wasn't sure what they were talking about so um yeah I have no

39
00:03:13,824 --> 00:03:14,304
complaints

40
00:03:15,391 --> 00:03:19,520
in terms of the fifth it's quite a casual dress anyway so

41
00:03:20,671 --> 00:03:25,919
I didn't have any issues with this I quite like wearing a relax style and

42
00:03:27,007 --> 00:03:31,615
I found that I haven't had any issues it it doesn't feel too tight anywhere

43
00:03:32,895 --> 00:03:37,055
and it's meant to be quite least fitting anyway so and it comes up for me

44
00:03:37,311 --> 00:03:42,751
I have read on other reviews that and some people have complained about how tight the

45
00:03:43,072 --> 00:03:46,944
arms are but as I haven't actually added the sleep bear I can't really comment on

46
00:03:47,007 --> 00:03:51,679
this but I'm a bit of sleeve I do have that comes off the main dress

47
00:03:52,063 --> 00:03:56,927
I haven't got any problems with that in terms of the design I've already said that

48
00:03:57,024 --> 00:04:02,272
I've decided and to not use the long sleeve variation although I think it would work

49
00:04:02,399 --> 00:04:03,871
very well with this fabric

50
00:04:05,055 --> 00:04:10,751
I like a casual dress so I'm very happy and with the design of this dress

51
00:04:12,703 --> 00:04:17,471
time taken this didn't take much time of tools and like I say due to the

52
00:04:17,567 --> 00:04:22,880
thickness of the fabric that was probably my main issue it probably took me just over

53
00:04:22,976 --> 00:04:27,679
a day and that's because I decided to leave the garment to hang overnight and and

54
00:04:27,712 --> 00:04:30,559
it did actually drop a bit so I'm glad I did

55
00:04:31,615 --> 00:04:34,272
weight that like the time before having it

56
00:04:36,191 --> 00:04:39,967
overall I'm really happy with this make I think I'm going to get a lot of

57
00:04:40,063 --> 00:04:44,480
where out of it I'd quite like to make another one as well so that's always

58
00:04:44,544 --> 00:04:45,216
a good sign
