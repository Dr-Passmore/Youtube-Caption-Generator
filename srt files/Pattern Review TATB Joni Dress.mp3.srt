00:00:01,088 --> 00:00:04,800
today I'm doing a pattern review of the journey dress by to the in the buttons

1
00:00:05,280 --> 00:00:11,487
so this dress actually comes out of the last book stretch by to the wounds and

2
00:00:11,552 --> 00:00:14,623
it's got a lovely range of passen so this is one of a few I've done

3
00:00:14,751 --> 00:00:15,456
out of that book

4
00:00:16,704 --> 00:00:21,823
I've made of signs for and the to do the button sizing it has made straight

5
00:00:21,888 --> 00:00:25,663
for the whole way throughout and the variation I've done it is like done in the

6
00:00:25,728 --> 00:00:26,336
short words

7
00:00:28,607 --> 00:00:31,840
in case you first leave the fabric I've chosen this was actually something already in my

8
00:00:31,936 --> 00:00:37,375
stash so I bought this at least one year ago possibly to and this is from

9
00:00:37,439 --> 00:00:42,976
my local habitat sherry so anyone who lives in Carmel will know will trigger so I

10
00:00:43,136 --> 00:00:47,296
got this from trago which is my little have ashery and

11
00:00:48,383 --> 00:00:53,312
yeah so it's it's an it fabric it's pretty stretching and it's quite thin but it

12
00:00:53,408 --> 00:00:57,535
drapes really well as you can tell I'm and it's quite substantial you know it's not

13
00:00:57,631 --> 00:01:01,888
see through its and I really like the pattern and it was I didn't need that

14
00:01:02,015 --> 00:01:06,592
much anything so that was handy know but it's a nice bit of detail on them

15
00:01:07,391 --> 00:01:12,064
okay so regarding the difficulty of the person I think this is probably a good person

16
00:01:12,160 --> 00:01:17,216
for confident beginners who already had a little devil with the net fabric so I mean

17
00:01:17,440 --> 00:01:22,400
even going through the stretch book would be an excellent way to introduce yourself to nets

18
00:01:22,655 --> 00:01:26,304
and which is the whole point of the book and could you start off with the

19
00:01:26,847 --> 00:01:33,152
baby skirt which you start with a much stable and onto solnet and then you progressed

20
00:01:33,248 --> 00:01:38,624
to the person's like this and that saying that I think this dress looks more complicated

21
00:01:38,688 --> 00:01:44,832
than it actually is so obviously the main detail is this twist at the top to

22
00:01:44,896 --> 00:01:50,783
be honest I actually followed satisfactions tutorial when it's rather than following the instructions I did

23
00:01:50,879 --> 00:01:55,872
read that people have had a bit of trouble following the pattern and in the actual

24
00:01:55,935 --> 00:02:00,351
book I'm not sure if this the case I might try following the instructions next time

25
00:02:00,704 --> 00:02:05,183
it is kind of symmetry them that I saw you know so factions made a number

26
00:02:05,279 --> 00:02:08,576
of them now I just thought I'd go ahead and to give that version echo and

27
00:02:08,608 --> 00:02:12,992
done yet it's worked fine I think it was just them the way so is faction

28
00:02:13,119 --> 00:02:16,960
shows you how to do it theoretically should be able to stitch so you don't have

29
00:02:17,024 --> 00:02:20,863
as much of a whole and next to the twist and yeah I'm happy with how

30
00:02:20,992 --> 00:02:26,143
it's turned out anyway so perhaps I will to stay with them the satisfaction instructions on

31
00:02:26,207 --> 00:02:26,559
marshal

32
00:02:27,904 --> 00:02:32,255
yes so in the book it tells you how to draft your own fled sleeves so

33
00:02:33,055 --> 00:02:37,951
their persons for a more fitted virgin you know that just goes around but I decided

34
00:02:38,048 --> 00:02:42,975
I really liked the flare to design so you do a bit of I guess Haston

35
00:02:43,039 --> 00:02:48,671
directing or passing cussing and and it's really simple you basically draw I think about three

36
00:02:48,768 --> 00:02:54,815
lines and you I'm slash and spread the sleeve peace and to give it that volume

37
00:02:55,839 --> 00:03:01,119
and I think I get my put between the lines how how much I spread it

38
00:03:01,184 --> 00:03:05,983
I think it was about ten cents Meese's I could be wrong with I think I

39
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:10,975
did the same as the book and said they did because I like to be about

40
00:03:11,007 --> 00:03:16,063
the Florent and that was in the photo for the book so yeah I'm but saying

41
00:03:16,128 --> 00:03:21,567
that it's a nice little introduction to minute placing or hacking persons which I think works

42
00:03:21,632 --> 00:03:26,367
really well there it was an extra step I found it really easy to do and

43
00:03:26,464 --> 00:03:30,240
which is always I'm Andy so yeah that then set me back to watch tool

44
00:03:31,679 --> 00:03:35,264
but if I did chanting to work out how I was short to cut the sleeves

45
00:03:35,712 --> 00:03:39,231
and but you know I'm happy with that I guess I could have done it it

46
00:03:39,264 --> 00:03:42,207
will draw a longer I don't know if maybe next time I'll experiments a bit more

47
00:03:44,063 --> 00:03:47,647
see yeah I'd say the most challenging party as it would be the twist it's probably

48
00:03:47,712 --> 00:03:51,136
the most intricate part the saying that is done not too bad it's quite challenging I

49
00:03:51,231 --> 00:03:53,440
guess serving on the

50
00:03:54,527 --> 00:03:55,136
neck winding

51
00:03:56,223 --> 00:03:59,264
I'm and also you elastic in the waist band

52
00:04:01,216 --> 00:04:03,968
I guess just the it comes back into shape and them

53
00:04:06,335 --> 00:04:11,520
so would say that's probably one of the more challenging aspects of the pattern but apart

54
00:04:11,583 --> 00:04:14,880
from that I'd say it I'd say it looks more calm created than it actually as

55
00:04:14,912 --> 00:04:19,679
to sew up in terms of clarity I think like with all of the other to

56
00:04:19,712 --> 00:04:27,104
lay the buttons pattens that I've completed that really and explain everything so well then they're

57
00:04:27,231 --> 00:04:29,440
very good for unit learning how to sew

58
00:04:31,071 --> 00:04:37,152
like I say I've heard that people had issues with the twist front and as I

59
00:04:37,247 --> 00:04:41,664
just kind of go off and find separate instructions just because I think I watched the

60
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:46,335
tutorial before even and started making the past an ally just below the I'll go back

61
00:04:46,399 --> 00:04:50,847
to that tutorial so I can't really vouch for the instructions they didn't look too bad

62
00:04:50,911 --> 00:04:51,424
when I read them

63
00:04:53,152 --> 00:04:54,944
but I think basically if you want to get

64
00:04:56,320 --> 00:05:00,160
close to finish I'm up to the twist so less of a whole you might want

65
00:05:00,191 --> 00:05:05,855
to look at I'm satisfactions tutorial tend to design and fit I really like the design

66
00:05:05,951 --> 00:05:09,279
of this grass which is why I decided to make it and I like the fact

67
00:05:09,312 --> 00:05:11,584
that there's some volume in the dress

68
00:05:13,055 --> 00:05:17,824
so it really works for you know a knit fabric like this which will unhang mostly

69
00:05:18,208 --> 00:05:24,320
emmies ego but more volume than some other addresses and the twist the told lovely and

70
00:05:24,544 --> 00:05:29,088
looks more completed than it actually is and yeah I really like the floods sleeves I

71
00:05:29,183 --> 00:05:32,928
think there are a really nice touch but then I think also there fitted sleeps low

72
00:05:33,279 --> 00:05:39,200
and the pattern starts off as already nice as well for a and its dress pattern

73
00:05:39,264 --> 00:05:42,015
as well and quite a simple one it's all so nice because it is a bit

74
00:05:42,079 --> 00:05:46,880
more fitted Salem forget people who are a bit more shapely and show off their figure

75
00:05:47,007 --> 00:05:47,391
a bit more

76
00:05:48,575 --> 00:05:53,760
with regards to fit and I didn't actually adjust anything I think if I made it

77
00:05:53,791 --> 00:05:57,247
again I might possibly make a slight adjustment because I've got a bit of this way

78
00:05:57,407 --> 00:06:02,496
back it doesn't really show because the net the I'm not the neckline the waistline is

79
00:06:02,559 --> 00:06:08,127
about higher than most persons although saying that I from like it is quite place to

80
00:06:08,191 --> 00:06:13,183
my natural waistline but maybe that's how the I'm fabric his stretched since I'm not sure

81
00:06:14,559 --> 00:06:19,104
and it also has a subtle debt time anyway so well there have God's way back

82
00:06:19,167 --> 00:06:25,183
I'm not sure it's that obvious in this net fabbro and with this particular pattern design

83
00:06:25,855 --> 00:06:32,640
saying that though I think next time I may possibly just take a bit out of

84
00:06:32,832 --> 00:06:38,015
the center back so because there is this team around the waist I think what I

85
00:06:38,079 --> 00:06:41,920
might do next time as with the back but is peace perhaps agreed it off of

86
00:06:41,984 --> 00:06:47,648
it you know possibly and into something or even just a centimeter Ratu just so that

87
00:06:47,776 --> 00:06:52,895
the skirt ends up being up a little bit higher and and you know some I

88
00:06:52,992 --> 00:06:56,191
might feel a bit more comfortable with that but it's saying that I think I can

89
00:06:56,256 --> 00:06:58,335
get away with not adjusting it on this occasion

90
00:06:59,424 --> 00:07:03,839
it's time taken it's quite difficult me to work out how long it took I took

91
00:07:03,903 --> 00:07:05,600
a bit of a break so I cut out

92
00:07:07,104 --> 00:07:13,631
and maybe I traced out the pieces and then I took a break because I was

93
00:07:13,727 --> 00:07:14,816
learning how to pass and cut

94
00:07:15,936 --> 00:07:19,712
all the basics of passing costing and then when I realized I had a swayback her

95
00:07:19,839 --> 00:07:23,167
and so do I change it do I not and so that kind of

96
00:07:24,287 --> 00:07:25,503
put it on the back burner for a bit

97
00:07:26,816 --> 00:07:28,959
and then I was also a bit put off by the fact that I did need

98
00:07:28,992 --> 00:07:33,920
to and slash and spread the sleeves and which was really searing kiss it didn't take

99
00:07:33,951 --> 00:07:37,247
that long until and it was really simple I think I just thought it was more

100
00:07:37,279 --> 00:07:39,040
complicated than it was so

101
00:07:40,768 --> 00:07:44,511
it would take longer than a really simple that person like you know the cocoa dressed

102
00:07:44,671 --> 00:07:51,264
that's really quick and making yourself I Wendy wards Walkley dressed as a really quick make

103
00:07:51,328 --> 00:07:56,640
of you if you want a really quick Walland introduction but yeah it's it's not it

104
00:07:56,671 --> 00:08:02,623
doesn't take that long and considering all the additional features you've got with the struck evil

105
00:08:02,783 --> 00:08:05,343
I'm really happy with this dress I think I'm going to get a lot of use

106
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:08,959
out that it's just really easy to sling on and go out the door I think

107
00:08:09,088 --> 00:08:14,144
I'm gonna make a lot of variations as well so I think I really want to

108
00:08:14,175 --> 00:08:17,536
try make and storage version I bought some red stripey approx so that will probably be

109
00:08:17,951 --> 00:08:21,920
the next person I make and to get over what I'm really happy and I really

110
00:08:21,984 --> 00:08:24,256
recommend the pattern thanks for watching
