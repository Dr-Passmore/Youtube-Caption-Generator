00:00:00,416 --> 00:00:06,144
today I'm sharing with you my talk non-essential luxury sewing license if you do enjoy this

1
00:00:06,208 --> 00:00:10,368
video and you haven't already pleasing forget the like and subscribe so I'm sure you all

2
00:00:10,432 --> 00:00:16,351
know there are loads of different sewing gadgets until without their or with different uses and

3
00:00:16,416 --> 00:00:24,191
some very specific some extremely versatile and it's quite difficult to navigate which one do you

4
00:00:24,416 --> 00:00:25,728
need which ones you don't

5
00:00:27,007 --> 00:00:30,208
and which ones would just make your life so much easier than to know I'm going

6
00:00:30,271 --> 00:00:33,791
to share the ones that I have in particular that I know what is not essential

7
00:00:33,824 --> 00:00:37,759
at all you definitely don't need them but they're there quite nice if I'm someone's asking

8
00:00:37,824 --> 00:00:41,855
you what you want for Christmas offer your birthday or just the trees in general and

9
00:00:41,919 --> 00:00:45,759
most of these are ones which I probably have received as a gift and I'm very

10
00:00:45,824 --> 00:00:49,695
appreciative of them so I'm going to share six different tools with you to number one

11
00:00:49,984 --> 00:00:55,040
is the biased finding that so the vice finding that I've had for a number of

12
00:00:55,104 --> 00:00:57,152
years now I think I actually I'm

13
00:00:58,175 --> 00:01:02,976
at this one of my mom who'd forces online I'm and I ended up acquiring it

14
00:01:03,391 --> 00:01:10,143
and so it's really handy attaching by is finding obviously I wouldn't say it's essential because

15
00:01:10,208 --> 00:01:14,944
obviously you can attach wise finding using a regular sewing machine that isn't by is finding

16
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:21,952
foot and depending on the item you're making and what you're covering with bias finding it

17
00:01:21,984 --> 00:01:27,008
can produce a really neat clean finish and sense to you can adjust it there's a

18
00:01:27,071 --> 00:01:32,384
little section here where you can slide it across depending on how why to your eyes

19
00:01:32,639 --> 00:01:36,896
finding it so you can see the go and some metric markers for the white hair

20
00:01:36,991 --> 00:01:41,760
so for five more meters ten fifteen twenty the main places where I've used this before

21
00:01:41,856 --> 00:01:46,751
is when I made path hats and it of got a bath papasan over on Etsy

22
00:01:47,456 --> 00:01:52,575
and on that it's really useful because I'm just touching by finding on the broom of

23
00:01:52,639 --> 00:01:55,328
the bath that and it's really easy to just

24
00:01:56,480 --> 00:02:01,407
stitch down the slide it means that you don't have to stitch on one side fold

25
00:02:01,503 --> 00:02:03,391
over and then stitch on

26
00:02:04,671 --> 00:02:09,567
top citril way around it just does the topstitch section through both layers and applies it

27
00:02:09,664 --> 00:02:14,304
you do have to be careful and make sure that your fabric is positioned properly into

28
00:02:14,399 --> 00:02:19,360
this tool so that its slotted and right into whether the guidance if you don't do

29
00:02:19,423 --> 00:02:21,151
that then there is a lot of unpicking to do

30
00:02:22,559 --> 00:02:27,839
so it's not essential because obviously you can just use your regular sown machine but to

31
00:02:27,936 --> 00:02:33,983
attach by us finding and actually nowadays I do prepare the finish where you stitch one

32
00:02:34,175 --> 00:02:37,888
side to the first side with your son machine any time over and I do like

33
00:02:37,983 --> 00:02:41,376
to hand so finish it now and then you just have a really nice clean edge

34
00:02:41,664 --> 00:02:46,399
and but obviously again you can just and flip it over and top stitcher so I

35
00:02:46,496 --> 00:02:50,783
guess in a way you save a bit of threat by using this tool and it'll

36
00:02:50,848 --> 00:02:54,367
take you a lot of time and it just depends really what you're doing quite unavoidable

37
00:02:54,848 --> 00:03:00,576
luxury iseum but like I say pans what finished you want and sometimes especially if it's

38
00:03:00,608 --> 00:03:04,735
already bulky saying you think that warding and it's gonna be quite hard to get into

39
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:09,919
the stage so it's not always useful luxury so nice and number two is a thing

40
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:14,464
age so I really like this scene gauge I've had it for a couple of years

41
00:03:14,527 --> 00:03:19,488
now it's really handy it's got this is a metric one by the way you can

42
00:03:19,583 --> 00:03:24,095
also get an imperial measurement one I just think it's really useful because it's got all

43
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:29,343
your main measurements that you will need to they obviously one heart centimeters which is my

44
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:35,136
days of an inch and that's the common when you'll find on your sewing persons but

45
00:03:35,167 --> 00:03:37,792
it will say has one sent to me so which I guess it's a bit more

46
00:03:37,856 --> 00:03:43,552
common if your sewing and its past him and six centimeters I think that's as standard

47
00:03:43,839 --> 00:03:48,800
hemp there's also for centimeters hair which she come across and two centimeters is quite common

48
00:03:48,927 --> 00:03:53,759
as well and for certain seems on your garment I also use this grid when we've

49
00:03:53,792 --> 00:03:59,136
got the sixth sense Mrs so it has all the lines for the millimeters and I

50
00:03:59,231 --> 00:04:03,104
do use that sometimes it and for quick reference I just find this tools a lot

51
00:04:03,199 --> 00:04:06,496
easier to use and but of course you can just use the tape measure and most

52
00:04:06,527 --> 00:04:10,080
people got a tape measure that of her spear take measures a lot more best file

53
00:04:10,143 --> 00:04:14,783
because you can you know measure yourselves you measure of the people with their I'm item

54
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:20,415
and said like the water bottle and carrier made you can you know replicate measure around

55
00:04:20,928 --> 00:04:25,727
the iseum that you want to measure where is this obviously it's very specific to and

56
00:04:26,272 --> 00:04:31,071
marking out smaller items or you know impressing but I do use it a lot to

57
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:35,936
press and mark seems just because it's a lot I guess it's a lot phanar than

58
00:04:36,351 --> 00:04:40,000
a tape measure or not sorry if I use it a lot more for pressing and

59
00:04:40,032 --> 00:04:43,648
especially you know when a party of hands or and presence that you can't see the

60
00:04:43,712 --> 00:04:48,671
same answer even marking the seam allowance because it's just a lot farmers and take mission

61
00:04:48,864 --> 00:04:52,992
in the past I have accidentally irons over a tape measure and not sure how accurate

62
00:04:53,119 --> 00:04:58,976
is anymore not sure how well they can withstand higher heat levels so and where is

63
00:04:59,071 --> 00:05:02,847
this I kind of feel like you know it's going to send the test to the

64
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:07,648
same machine a stool heat levels or it hasn't dated anyone I've definitely I do right

65
00:05:07,712 --> 00:05:08,511
by accident so

66
00:05:09,631 --> 00:05:11,776
yeah I just find it's a nice consistent way to

67
00:05:13,247 --> 00:05:17,279
use it in that way this is probably the cheapest until that I'm sharing with you

68
00:05:17,471 --> 00:05:17,824
and I'd say

69
00:05:18,847 --> 00:05:23,200
it's a really useful one so if someone is looking for a little gift for you

70
00:05:23,584 --> 00:05:28,063
this is the perfect suggestion if you don't have one already moving from cheap and cheerful

71
00:05:28,223 --> 00:05:34,399
to very luxuriously expensive is this fiscals cutting tool so

72
00:05:35,519 --> 00:05:39,967
this was definitely left and I haven't had it all I had it less than a

73
00:05:40,032 --> 00:05:46,368
year and essentially it's a fabric guillotine so you place this over your that broke its

74
00:05:46,432 --> 00:05:51,967
part of us all so essentially you place this over your fabric using a coughing that's

75
00:05:52,063 --> 00:05:52,575
like this one

76
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:58,623
and you mine it up to where you want it to be and then you apply

77
00:05:58,752 --> 00:06:04,127
pressure to this and hotter crops they obviously this is amazing if you're a quota because

78
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:09,664
you can just cut straight lines really easily with it and you couldn't also cut quite

79
00:06:09,727 --> 00:06:13,696
a few layers of fabric in one go which is handy as well at all sees

80
00:06:13,727 --> 00:06:19,424
the indirect making that if there is a really that I'm him say or some of

81
00:06:19,455 --> 00:06:24,320
the sides it can be useful to cut those but mythically you know quitting but making

82
00:06:24,415 --> 00:06:28,256
bags any accessories in that if it's a straight line and you know I made a

83
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:34,944
cushion recently and you can just really easily and accurately cost out straight lines which is

84
00:06:35,007 --> 00:06:39,872
amazing is this way to replicate this in a much cheaper fashion would be to just

85
00:06:39,936 --> 00:06:44,640
have a regular ruler or even a quoting really like this which would still be a

86
00:06:44,704 --> 00:06:50,144
lot cheaper than this and the and dingily acquitting ruler and your

87
00:06:51,679 --> 00:06:56,447
rotary cutter so that would be simple I guess the advantage or is that it's fixed

88
00:06:56,480 --> 00:07:00,384
to this part so you can sometimes veer off for that even when using a ruler

89
00:07:01,536 --> 00:07:06,816
and that's on its own that again this obviously is a logic of them even the

90
00:07:06,847 --> 00:07:11,488
rotary castor and the rulers more luxury in initially goes the scissors and marking out the

91
00:07:11,552 --> 00:07:14,559
line okay so I may have done to come by saying that the scene goes was

92
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:19,776
the cheapest by some on my luxury serving license list and because no before is one

93
00:07:19,839 --> 00:07:25,183
of these which is one of those so I push out the corner tools they are

94
00:07:25,216 --> 00:07:29,727
this is really useful it's got a nice home point so that you can push out

95
00:07:29,791 --> 00:07:31,839
those corners without hopefully jabbing a hole

96
00:07:33,055 --> 00:07:38,303
in your fabric as you push out the corners of use their plenty of times and

97
00:07:38,335 --> 00:07:43,552
labels a gift and I'm very appreciative with it again the reason I put it as

98
00:07:43,967 --> 00:07:48,928
a non-essential is because I'm sure there are plenty of things you could find around the

99
00:07:48,992 --> 00:07:49,567
house to

100
00:07:50,783 --> 00:07:56,447
out your corners I see is a mess pair missing the door quite a lot although

101
00:07:56,768 --> 00:08:01,664
to be honest I used to end up poking a hole into the fabric a lot

102
00:08:01,696 --> 00:08:06,368
of the time when I did that so it's not the most recommended author and pushing

103
00:08:06,463 --> 00:08:12,127
out corners luxury siring to number five is the chalk man I've put this down at

104
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:16,992
the luxury tool because obviously you can just use regular Taylor's joke you do not need

105
00:08:17,119 --> 00:08:21,440
it and and the pond the sensor but it is very useful I find start with

106
00:08:21,536 --> 00:08:28,223
the regular and Taylor's chalk sometimes I end up breaking a bit of it early like

107
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:32,447
this one because that came with a range of colors so you can quite easily and

108
00:08:32,512 --> 00:08:33,343
if you hold it on the top

109
00:08:34,432 --> 00:08:42,495
you can change the chalk colleagues Porsena it also produces quite a nice accurate line which

110
00:08:42,624 --> 00:08:48,288
obviously over time the other tamers talk that's in a triangle a square it does where

111
00:08:48,351 --> 00:08:51,648
I obviously you can then sharpen it to a point again by guess this is always

112
00:08:51,711 --> 00:08:55,935
ready to go and it's quick and but it's definitely a luxurious you don't need it

113
00:08:56,064 --> 00:08:58,239
to dress make and finally

114
00:08:59,328 --> 00:09:04,416
luxury item number six I kind of combine to him because it's the mini ironing board

115
00:09:04,575 --> 00:09:10,047
and I am set and again pretty straightforward boy it's a luxury item if you already

116
00:09:10,208 --> 00:09:16,064
proselyting boards you don't need of anyone and again if you buy implores you probably got

117
00:09:16,127 --> 00:09:19,679
a regular iron of which means you don't need a miniature item oversee if you do

118
00:09:20,064 --> 00:09:25,567
lift somewhere where you don't have a of space and then by means and many ironing

119
00:09:25,599 --> 00:09:30,783
board is definitely not a luxury item and its beneficial it means it takes up less

120
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:35,039
room swim I'm and also this is actually you're really good on and so you know

121
00:09:35,359 --> 00:09:39,872
it would obviously take you a lot longer as the iron your includes but it's definitely

122
00:09:39,935 --> 00:09:44,831
doable I find both of these really useful just because I can just set it up

123
00:09:45,023 --> 00:09:47,679
on this table hear it means that they had to keep lashing out to heal the

124
00:09:47,744 --> 00:09:51,679
room to iron I sometimes to put the aisle in this room but obviously I do

125
00:09:51,968 --> 00:09:57,440
share this room with my partner who sometimes like Steve this computer say and I don't

126
00:09:57,471 --> 00:10:01,599
think he always appreciate having an iron board right behind his chair which is obviously a

127
00:10:01,632 --> 00:10:06,880
bit dangerous so it's a lot safer if I use and this island good and so

128
00:10:06,943 --> 00:10:07,200
here they

129
00:10:09,632 --> 00:10:14,463
come up like this and this was from ikea and I think this is it an

130
00:10:14,591 --> 00:10:15,007
answer

131
00:10:17,919 --> 00:10:21,823
yes and this does steam as well so you can that waters but and it's really

132
00:10:21,888 --> 00:10:25,664
handy if you've got something small especially if you're doing a project you know and like

133
00:10:25,728 --> 00:10:30,143
when I was making my bag all the water Bhattacharyya all the pass you know it's

134
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:34,463
it's a lot of have to bring out the a guiding board and iron and so

135
00:10:34,591 --> 00:10:39,328
you can save a bit of time by I'm just popping out the meaning set and

136
00:10:39,359 --> 00:10:43,487
then you can leave it up while doing the project so it's quite handy especially if

137
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:48,255
you know you are short on time or like me got a chronic house issue sometimes

138
00:10:48,799 --> 00:10:53,984
and kylies little corners can make it so much easier feed to and get on my

139
00:10:54,047 --> 00:10:57,984
the craft project and but like say if you're really short on space and money you

140
00:10:58,080 --> 00:11:03,007
really don't need it if you do have a regular I'm an ironing board so that's

141
00:11:03,168 --> 00:11:07,200
it but today I'm sure there are plenty of other non-essential tools that I've got I

142
00:11:07,392 --> 00:11:13,184
definitely got lots of sewing paraphernalia and so I'm sure there's plenty of other things that

143
00:11:13,247 --> 00:11:17,728
I haven't mentioned here but I thought that would be a good snapshot for you I

144
00:11:17,791 --> 00:11:19,455
hope you enjoyed this and thanks for watching
