00:00:00,479 --> 00:00:03,776
today I'm reviewing the birth the guard again as always that you might this video and

1
00:00:03,808 --> 00:00:07,584
what Seymour please don't forget the like to subscribe if you haven't already so today I'm

2
00:00:07,616 --> 00:00:12,000
wearing the birth their cars again which is in the new tulu one book and by

3
00:00:12,095 --> 00:00:16,128
to the the Boston this is the book care to make it simple easy speeding sewing

4
00:00:16,191 --> 00:00:20,096
projects to stitch up in an afternoon this is my first project from the book I

5
00:00:20,159 --> 00:00:25,215
do plan to make several projects from the book just so I can review the book

6
00:00:25,312 --> 00:00:30,944
more comprehensively I decided to start with the best cardigan more tactically because I thought it

7
00:00:31,007 --> 00:00:35,327
would be the quickest might take the pastor details other mentioned it's called better

8
00:00:36,352 --> 00:00:41,919
the variation I've done is the plane version so I haven't added any pockets I haven't

9
00:00:41,984 --> 00:00:47,136
been any book color are designing or anything like that and I haven't added the samples

10
00:00:47,231 --> 00:00:50,816
in the cup which is another option that you can do the design houses to be

11
00:00:50,847 --> 00:00:54,624
in the button from this book and finally the side I've made it is a street

12
00:00:54,655 --> 00:00:59,872
plies for but the fabric I biggest this is the fabric that but mentally my mammographic

13
00:00:59,936 --> 00:01:06,015
an album which I've mentioned before thinking my kindergarten review and also the reviewer made all

14
00:01:06,367 --> 00:01:12,384
the baby pitiful essentially I used the wrong fabric that both red fabrics and I wanted

15
00:01:12,416 --> 00:01:16,736
this one for the kinda card again for my Nan ended up cutting a thicker fabric

16
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:21,632
for that one so I have to rethink why was doing with the other fabric that

17
00:01:21,727 --> 00:01:26,239
the remnants of anyway and I have this left over my static and he said as

18
00:01:26,272 --> 00:01:30,304
a mansion its thinner than the fabric that I ended up making the publican into my

19
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:35,391
name it's a single nets so you can see is I'm essentially if you're netizen like

20
00:01:35,456 --> 00:01:40,639
stocking such so there's the whole side on the back and the net side on the

21
00:01:40,736 --> 00:01:45,727
front it's a nice greatly fabric actually so if I take it off you can see

22
00:01:45,856 --> 00:01:47,199
it behind nicely

23
00:01:49,599 --> 00:01:53,440
it is a thin fabric but I do actually find it quite worn when I'm wearing

24
00:01:53,503 --> 00:01:57,216
it can't remember where he got this fabric actually it's been in my smash for a

25
00:01:57,344 --> 00:02:01,183
while I decided to use this fabric because first later with a myself it meant I

26
00:02:01,311 --> 00:02:05,695
won't have to spend any more money and second I really like the color of the

27
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:11,871
fabric and I thought it would be quite good to dress up and down so I

28
00:02:11,968 --> 00:02:16,320
could wear it to work for example for serving with this hybrid it will find this

29
00:02:16,384 --> 00:02:21,695
over I didn't have any major problems I did have trouble cutting out though so when

30
00:02:21,792 --> 00:02:24,800
I was putting it out I did actually have to recast a couple of the pieces

31
00:02:24,895 --> 00:02:30,240
because I realized I had actually laid out completely flat and it was it was then

32
00:02:30,304 --> 00:02:35,072
going to hang about walking so I did report of events in times of difficulty it's

33
00:02:35,167 --> 00:02:40,128
a nice simple quick make as with a lot to summon the buttons passed and they

34
00:02:40,223 --> 00:02:44,255
do have begin at the mind and especially for this book because that is make it

35
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:49,311
simple they're trying to make their own simplest projects that can I forget you're so go

36
00:02:49,408 --> 00:02:52,895
back or if you're a beginner it's a nice one that you don't have to worry

37
00:02:52,927 --> 00:02:59,360
too much about fits or to have too many complicated construction techniques in it I feel

38
00:02:59,423 --> 00:03:04,960
that doesn't is the case in this instance it's got more passive pieces than other simple

39
00:03:05,184 --> 00:03:09,216
pattens for example or cocoa dress it's very simple of got running back these and then

40
00:03:09,248 --> 00:03:14,240
you can and cuffs that you want and the extra color peace but essentially you could

41
00:03:14,272 --> 00:03:18,688
just make out of a couple of happen pieces this you've got the two front pieces

42
00:03:18,783 --> 00:03:24,352
of the back peace the cuts the a neckband and you've also got the headband here

43
00:03:24,416 --> 00:03:28,031
as well however do not decided by having to cut all those least about it's definitely

44
00:03:28,223 --> 00:03:31,679
a fun project to make and you don't have to worry about pressing up the hem

45
00:03:31,776 --> 00:03:36,352
because you got the hand and there and likewise the cuffs and the met around it

46
00:03:36,447 --> 00:03:41,024
all finishes off those edges for you to crises instructions I found the nice and clear

47
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:46,559
or eyes it was lit at the checklist so in this book in cross a checklist

48
00:03:47,296 --> 00:03:51,296
that each person so unless the other things they got what they call short cut steps

49
00:03:51,871 --> 00:03:54,688
and it's a nice little checklist what you can

50
00:03:55,904 --> 00:04:01,951
barons so that economically with your time as possible so it put everything to confess that

51
00:04:01,983 --> 00:04:05,055
the things I don't see him in everything will go then it was you what you

52
00:04:05,087 --> 00:04:10,175
can stitch or at the same time what you can turn then it goes back so

53
00:04:10,399 --> 00:04:13,632
we can enter after you've done all those steps so I didn't follow the checklist rather

54
00:04:13,664 --> 00:04:18,432
than going for them along hands of version but I did to look back at the

55
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:23,135
instructions the more detailed instructions when I was a look that confused on the part sir

56
00:04:23,167 --> 00:04:26,944
if I just wanted to double-check that I was doing it correct me so I still

57
00:04:27,007 --> 00:04:30,687
use them but it was why nice to just have a really simple and checklist to

58
00:04:31,007 --> 00:04:33,791
look through and I think that did speed up the time to for the bits that

59
00:04:33,824 --> 00:04:40,895
I did check over which were a few bits I found like with my previous experience

60
00:04:40,992 --> 00:04:46,623
with telling the Boston pattern it was nice and straightforward clear and understandable from the images

61
00:04:46,752 --> 00:04:51,776
and to the text it design unfit I think it's a really nice pattern that didn't

62
00:04:51,839 --> 00:04:56,223
time for this to be a gun I could wear to work and I think it's

63
00:04:56,256 --> 00:04:57,600
still in I am a little bit

64
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:01,664
I don't know I felt like it was it looks quite casual so I will need

65
00:05:01,696 --> 00:05:06,463
to have to think about what to wear it with very likely neck and become down

66
00:05:06,559 --> 00:05:10,847
at side and I like the handbound as well I do think next time I might

67
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:15,295
possibly had a bit more night on to the sleeves it was spent fine but I

68
00:05:15,391 --> 00:05:19,743
think ever wearing it over the day it probably will creep up my arm would say

69
00:05:20,447 --> 00:05:26,528
next time I would possibly add not too much at mayst an inch or two but

70
00:05:26,559 --> 00:05:28,032
that's just the I quite like

71
00:05:29,152 --> 00:05:33,183
long sleeves so you know and but say that you know this length is for to

72
00:05:33,247 --> 00:05:37,376
be fine for me it's just my preference would be forcibly at it and

73
00:05:38,944 --> 00:05:42,208
it's all my hands a bit more just isn't a bit easier it's worth noting that

74
00:05:42,303 --> 00:05:46,559
I did make this pretty much slowly on the overlocker because I have one and I

75
00:05:46,623 --> 00:05:50,944
thought I'd take advantage the block is so quick to be honest and that definitely spent

76
00:05:51,007 --> 00:05:54,944
me up the only bit that I had to do on the sewing machine would you

77
00:05:55,071 --> 00:06:01,920
do a couple of securing stitches at the autumn on the handbound this is just to

78
00:06:02,015 --> 00:06:04,864
make sure that the same for the

79
00:06:06,432 --> 00:06:11,359
neckband doesn't end up and picking out at the bottom at the only reason I had

80
00:06:11,424 --> 00:06:15,584
to thread up the sewing machine but everything else was done on the overlocker one thing

81
00:06:15,679 --> 00:06:22,656
I have noticed is that the cuff him keeps funding over towards the cuff rather than

82
00:06:22,944 --> 00:06:27,200
to the slave and possibly a for topstitch that it would result it is up to

83
00:06:27,264 --> 00:06:31,071
say in instructions but depending on your fabric you might want stiva I did press it

84
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:36,000
in place that is just not staying and it does bought me a little bit but

85
00:06:36,351 --> 00:06:37,888
I mean it's a really tiny

86
00:06:39,167 --> 00:06:44,895
things that obviously had a result really easily by just adding some by the exact stitch

87
00:06:45,152 --> 00:06:49,791
or and to needle on that the time take then I was very intrigued to find

88
00:06:49,855 --> 00:06:53,376
out how long it take me just because this book does give you some guide time

89
00:06:53,536 --> 00:06:57,631
so you for this project it says that the cutting side is fortunate and some time

90
00:06:57,696 --> 00:07:02,144
as an hour last five so cutting fine forty minutes it's definitely took me longer but

91
00:07:02,208 --> 00:07:08,256
I would say that I am quite a slow Costa say it and also this fabric

92
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:11,808
was so hard to lay out and as I mentioned that did it wrong so it

93
00:07:11,839 --> 00:07:16,191
definitely take me probably more like an hour to consult however if you use an easier

94
00:07:16,256 --> 00:07:19,615
fabric or just within the need to probably will take in a verbal two minutes but

95
00:07:19,679 --> 00:07:26,528
setting time I would think it took me about two hours twenty where is the book

96
00:07:26,623 --> 00:07:30,944
same an hour thirty five the younger is anything in a life feet that should designed

97
00:07:31,007 --> 00:07:35,584
it similar to a recipe book where you have a good time for the prep time

98
00:07:35,743 --> 00:07:39,872
and cooking time which is because then it means that like you're keeping you can find

99
00:07:39,903 --> 00:07:44,384
your sewing accordingly I think in that same light it's a bit like said recipe books

100
00:07:44,447 --> 00:07:50,335
where you know don't take you a bit longer sometimes especially if it is the first

101
00:07:50,399 --> 00:07:54,463
time you've done a rescue so obviously this is the first time I've made it so

102
00:07:54,623 --> 00:07:58,911
I'll be interested if I make another one whether I managed maker in a much faster

103
00:07:58,976 --> 00:08:02,944
time I checked not to our pockets because I wanted it to look very smart for

104
00:08:02,976 --> 00:08:07,488
what just person reference but I just felt like the pocket it's my own attracted from

105
00:08:07,936 --> 00:08:12,928
the knife simple and the good design of this version of that makes sense to conclude

106
00:08:13,055 --> 00:08:18,783
I really enjoyed making this project I think it was really interesting to quite strictly trapped

107
00:08:18,847 --> 00:08:21,791
my time to see how it compared with the book and I are not quite fun

108
00:08:21,951 --> 00:08:25,279
and a bit of a challenge the other thing to mention actually with the time bring

109
00:08:25,696 --> 00:08:30,048
is that I should have been a lot more prepared to get it up because I

110
00:08:30,175 --> 00:08:35,135
probably did waste time go Oh I can't find this particular tool or item more you

111
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:40,031
know what the long didn't have the heiling board set up all the time so I'd

112
00:08:40,064 --> 00:08:44,000
have to quickly ditali birds and then I'm trying to find my press inkle so that

113
00:08:44,064 --> 00:08:47,935
I wouldn't burn the fabric but be able to get a much better press illness fabric

114
00:08:48,223 --> 00:08:51,968
so there are lots insist me to help so perhaps if I like leaving a bit

115
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:56,768
more organized with my tools I might have made this a lot recommend it I was

116
00:08:56,799 --> 00:09:02,080
twenty several I'm really happy with this make I would make it again have imagined might

117
00:09:02,176 --> 00:09:05,471
add a bit link to the sleeves it family is something you could make in an

118
00:09:05,567 --> 00:09:10,943
afternoon because that's laisser it took me less muttering a half hours and took them to

119
00:09:11,007 --> 00:09:16,351
make the whole thing so during how hours it's definitely the problem of an afternoon and

120
00:09:16,512 --> 00:09:19,840
yeah I look forward to you trying out some more of the mix in the book

121
00:09:20,064 --> 00:09:21,664
that's it to today thanks for watching
