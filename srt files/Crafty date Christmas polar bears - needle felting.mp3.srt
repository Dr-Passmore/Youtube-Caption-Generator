2
00:00:12,895 --> 00:00:15,871
says that yeah it souls with the station which

3
00:00:17,408 --> 00:00:21,312
yes so will go with crafty date for now but if we've changed the name in

4
00:00:21,375 --> 00:00:27,072
the interim it's because we thought of something a bit better all changed our mind

5
00:00:30,527 --> 00:00:32,672
so basically what we're going to do is

6
00:00:34,271 --> 00:00:40,799
do some craft based activity together and so today you choose an are activity Hanako

7
00:00:42,208 --> 00:00:49,631
and toward Christmas yeah yeah so we've got this a tree decoration boulting it from Bobby

8
00:00:49,759 --> 00:00:57,119
craft so you choose a from hobby graft the other week than you yeah because I

9
00:00:57,248 --> 00:01:01,215
didn't see it you just suddenly turned up for that and went Hey it's three pounds

10
00:01:02,495 --> 00:01:05,216
will not keep polar bears get the

11
00:01:08,319 --> 00:01:08,575
right

12
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:13,216
so I don't really do any crush

13
00:01:14,847 --> 00:01:21,120
is a crafty one so open she used to do some life into it

14
00:01:25,055 --> 00:01:27,552
open not gonna help you with felt but

15
00:01:30,847 --> 00:01:37,599
I've never done needle felting either I've used an imbalanced it before and in a textiles

16
00:01:37,695 --> 00:01:37,952
class

17
00:01:38,975 --> 00:01:43,839
and I've tried a bit of wet belting and but not needle felting before so this

18
00:01:43,903 --> 00:01:44,928
will be news both us

19
00:01:52,192 --> 00:02:14,496
what we should have precontact attention and but

20
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:22,496
it's true

21
00:02:24,479 --> 00:02:27,423
so we've got the instructions on the back of

22
00:02:42,944 --> 00:02:49,856
the well yes and then we've got them other colors which

23
00:02:50,880 --> 00:03:03,583
be for their own accessories for little to come with an older needles

24
00:03:13,759 --> 00:03:16,895
that terrified the shop I can't have cut down

25
00:03:20,544 --> 00:03:25,055
I was seeing my face be able to do you are they different sizes I don't

26
00:03:25,087 --> 00:03:25,856
know enough about

27
00:03:27,968 --> 00:03:30,016
the swallow

28
00:03:38,559 --> 00:03:43,520
and that's kind of the thing I think he stabbed into I want to do Nomex

29
00:03:43,615 --> 00:03:47,904
then you will say got these and so we made the shape of the pool of

30
00:03:47,968 --> 00:03:49,983
us did they stay inside

31
00:03:51,423 --> 00:03:54,143
I do just stop it into the phone and the Loki

32
00:03:55,552 --> 00:03:58,048
he's a good question something the retreat dropped out

33
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,983
and then some one for it

34
00:04:05,024 --> 00:04:06,304
right along the way

35
00:04:08,031 --> 00:04:08,287
okay

36
00:04:16,096 --> 00:04:21,791
before you get started separate out all of your felt shapes you can identify which shapes

37
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:24,415
they used for each part of the pole of as

38
00:04:33,567 --> 00:04:37,471
I realized there was the same size actually I but they were like you know you

39
00:04:37,567 --> 00:04:40,735
rode up once in a baby one Burgess' just

40
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:52,160
okay how to make president's times three

41
00:04:53,407 --> 00:05:06,368
divide main fair father into three equal pilot heads

42
00:05:14,687 --> 00:05:16,447
into the dirt away

43
00:05:23,967 --> 00:05:27,839
what a separate off some of the lot of my dad was there would have the

44
00:05:27,936 --> 00:05:34,656
scale that make sure they were able to get the scales there's light then I don't

45
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:38,463
know what do you think what is it not really matter what happens the scales for

46
00:05:38,528 --> 00:05:41,536
the voices could be really hard to tell him into the team

47
00:05:44,415 --> 00:05:45,407
right quick break

48
00:06:00,447 --> 00:06:07,167
take one boarding born wrap in roving and hold walls gently stabbing in a downward motion

49
00:06:07,424 --> 00:06:13,088
with unbelting me what to his ear the wall to the policy in the shape you

50
00:06:13,183 --> 00:06:19,776
not stop to hearts so things just isn't too like product about with did you go

51
00:06:19,903 --> 00:06:21,023
through the to

52
00:06:22,687 --> 00:06:25,600
the more you felt the family or what he will be

53
00:06:26,816 --> 00:06:29,119
you just you don't you like I think

54
00:06:36,671 --> 00:06:41,951
when you do where felting and of have to like teach them out and makes us

55
00:06:43,519 --> 00:06:46,528
shoot of its I don't know few days for the

56
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:56,735
I'm just wondering what do you think I guess maybe you don't have to such a

57
00:06:56,799 --> 00:06:57,855
safe racket round as

58
00:07:07,519 --> 00:07:12,895
I read the next instruction to shatter wrapper section a small section will around your thing

59
00:07:13,023 --> 00:07:14,463
as in a place in the front

60
00:07:15,903 --> 00:07:19,936
of the front of the head where the snow would be felt into the time

61
00:07:24,447 --> 00:07:27,167
had more for that definition to that

62
00:07:36,127 --> 00:07:38,048
when you got to save of it for his leg

63
00:08:19,584 --> 00:08:20,384
maybe you just

64
00:08:26,528 --> 00:08:28,032
because which it helps some

65
00:08:47,296 --> 00:08:57,760
export I think I promise my quite nice people out you know that I might add

66
00:08:57,919 --> 00:09:03,200
the more is not very big as don't quite bit less then it gets my tool

67
00:09:05,088 --> 00:09:08,671
as maybe's this is like when you're making a hat

68
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:14,400
pretty sure it's like that as much I know about to

69
00:09:17,471 --> 00:09:18,719
this might take while on time

70
00:09:20,192 --> 00:09:23,007
yes I really so diffuse I'm

71
00:09:24,223 --> 00:09:29,856
a machine based in Belisha it's like this but it's got about

72
00:09:31,072 --> 00:09:36,255
six needles so it it's really with services the new carpet that you don't like Fred

73
00:09:36,927 --> 00:09:40,799
but it's just a machine and he used the pedal and you can determine how quickly

74
00:09:41,504 --> 00:09:41,567
the

75
00:09:42,687 --> 00:09:43,616
needle punch down

76
00:09:46,432 --> 00:09:49,280
so it's really nice that they're actually quite spend what they are

77
00:09:50,559 --> 00:09:52,192
very good if you're doing lots of

78
00:09:55,616 --> 00:09:56,096
fishing

79
00:10:08,831 --> 00:10:10,687
I've never seen them the

80
00:10:11,744 --> 00:10:13,471
needle thing that like this to me like

81
00:10:31,711 --> 00:10:35,840
this the more you punch it with the needle the more has that so very unmuffled

82
00:10:35,903 --> 00:10:37,056
effect like the front cover

83
00:10:38,111 --> 00:10:43,552
so the less you can see the mines enough so it is good to practice yes

84
00:10:43,616 --> 00:10:45,247
the use of so much more thicker than mine

85
00:10:49,056 --> 00:10:51,776
I know that's why means you think I've been nice to know I'm pretty just as

86
00:10:51,872 --> 00:10:52,671
not let alone

87
00:10:59,487 --> 00:11:01,375
come to sweeten of that scene from aliens

88
00:11:02,911 --> 00:11:03,711
the bishop with

89
00:11:06,304 --> 00:11:10,783
white with the yeah I've seen another finger reference and

90
00:11:13,599 --> 00:11:23,903
surprise yes actually as well as you requested yes making me think about that that sort

91
00:11:23,935 --> 00:11:24,031
of

92
00:11:26,528 --> 00:11:26,848
rhythm

93
00:11:28,127 --> 00:11:31,968
use it didn't really see a kind of six bit like a hammer

94
00:11:33,023 --> 00:11:34,047
we can anything

95
00:11:40,544 --> 00:11:45,088
maybe we were gonna make although that the same size we are going to make like

96
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:48,895
three bears fresh

97
00:11:51,392 --> 00:11:53,791
it was the rusty little discussion

98
00:18:43,776 --> 00:18:45,920
and were back after a short break

99
00:18:46,943 --> 00:18:49,760
was chained by clouds because this isn't taking for

100
00:18:52,927 --> 00:18:58,400
welcome to day to of three decoration something hit by a hobby craft

best me to go a bit too into and

104
00:19:18,368 --> 00:19:24,000
damaged his tool might be why you get to you rather than you know that the
