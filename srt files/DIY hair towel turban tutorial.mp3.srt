00:00:06,975 --> 00:00:12,095
hello its Clary from clubber creations today I'm going to show you how to make a

1
00:00:12,223 --> 00:00:13,472
hare towel turban

2
00:00:15,008 --> 00:00:19,072
so in front of me I've got the printed Patton

3
00:00:20,384 --> 00:00:27,263
so I've turned this into a PDF Paston it's based off and the past and I

4
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:31,840
made when I made one for my Nan for Christmas and I thought and other people

5
00:00:31,903 --> 00:00:33,088
might want to have a ghost it

6
00:00:34,431 --> 00:00:40,639
so there's an introduction page just advising you how to and print it out as with

7
00:00:40,736 --> 00:00:45,023
other PDA pattens you've got to make sure it's on a hundred percent or actual size

8
00:00:45,312 --> 00:00:49,728
and there's also on page two which is on part of the pattern there is a

9
00:00:50,111 --> 00:00:56,448
test square so you can just print out page to check the scalings correct and it

10
00:00:56,512 --> 00:01:00,832
measures up to ten centimeters all four inches and then you can go ahead and front

11
00:01:00,895 --> 00:01:01,408
the rest

12
00:01:02,687 --> 00:01:07,711
I will say got and the fabric I need so I'm actually using

13
00:01:09,407 --> 00:01:15,711
both shapes I find it quite hard to source tomming fabric and it's quite expensive so

14
00:01:16,096 --> 00:01:22,624
answer this project I've just got a bath sheet from my kiah and its roughly a

15
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:28,160
hundred centimeters by a hundred and fifty but for this project you only need about

16
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:33,344
I'd say about three quarters of the matter you should be able to squeeze one out

17
00:01:33,375 --> 00:01:37,632
of that if you do you manage to find some suitable fabric in a store I

18
00:01:37,695 --> 00:01:42,975
will say god and of course of elastic here so this is the quarter inch but

19
00:01:44,096 --> 00:01:49,856
I'd probably go for a slightly thinner than sekar elastic just because you want to be

20
00:01:49,919 --> 00:01:53,919
able to loop at round your button okay I'm which brings me onto

21
00:01:55,232 --> 00:01:56,575
and that you need a button as well

22
00:01:58,367 --> 00:02:01,856
and then I've got my matching threads and a bobbin to go with it

23
00:02:03,199 --> 00:02:06,975
right so first things first I'm going to construct the PDF person

24
00:02:11,455 --> 00:02:12,639
where's my guillotine

25
00:02:15,391 --> 00:02:17,824
have you seen it anywhere we put it in the box

26
00:02:19,104 --> 00:02:19,520
rubber that

27
00:02:24,255 --> 00:02:31,231
I've left quite a large margin on my PDF pattens just so that it definitely prints

28
00:02:31,328 --> 00:02:37,408
on different sized paper so it should work for us and UK and size paper what

29
00:02:37,472 --> 00:02:42,464
I normally do as I leave the first she and don't bother casting off anything on

30
00:02:42,527 --> 00:02:47,839
that one and then on the next one eye caught the left-hand side

31
00:02:48,927 --> 00:02:52,384
and then when I get to the next row I do the left hand slide and

32
00:02:52,416 --> 00:02:56,863
the top as you don't need to cut off all the edges and they should help

33
00:02:56,927 --> 00:02:57,727
you line it up

34
00:04:34,368 --> 00:04:39,519
okay now that I have cut out my template I just thought I'd highlight a few

35
00:04:39,648 --> 00:04:46,272
points on the pattern so I've marked for notches on this person two of them have

36
00:04:46,368 --> 00:04:51,040
labeled the other two don't the two that don't that around the long curve

37
00:04:52,223 --> 00:04:56,032
these ones are just simply to help you line up to two pieces before you say

38
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:57,727
them up the other two

39
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:03,359
I've got one at the bottom and one at the top

40
00:05:04,544 --> 00:05:09,247
there's one which is labeled button placement markers so that's just to help give you a

41
00:05:09,376 --> 00:05:13,119
guide of where to place your bus at the end but obviously you can adjust that

42
00:05:13,567 --> 00:05:15,104
I'm and I've also got

43
00:05:16,895 --> 00:05:22,208
one at the top and this one is an elastic placement marker

44
00:05:23,391 --> 00:05:28,544
so that's where you're going to add your elastic so it's um it's worth adding those

45
00:05:29,279 --> 00:05:34,303
marks on to your fabric but yes so now I'm going to cut out my fabric

46
00:05:35,455 --> 00:05:40,640
right so much you can see on the camera that on my fabric I've actually used

47
00:05:41,567 --> 00:05:48,000
the stripey section on it so with this and it's quite handy to find out where

48
00:05:50,079 --> 00:05:53,343
you know to to get it lined up nice and evenly

49
00:05:54,463 --> 00:05:59,040
and but obviously there is also a grainline printed on there to help you

50
00:06:58,496 --> 00:07:04,191
so once you've cut out your fabric pieces it's time to add the elastic so for

51
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:07,295
this you need to grab one of the pieces

52
00:07:09,152 --> 00:07:12,928
and you need to have it right side out so I'm just gonna take the bottom

53
00:07:13,055 --> 00:07:15,743
layer as that one's right side up already

54
00:07:17,119 --> 00:07:21,119
the first thing you need to do if you haven't done already is to cut your

55
00:07:21,503 --> 00:07:24,447
piece of elastic to eight centimeters long

56
00:07:29,631 --> 00:07:32,864
right you need to hold your elastic peace in half

57
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:34,463
light sight

58
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,055
and then you need to

59
00:07:38,623 --> 00:07:44,735
guess it to meet with the raw edges on your fabric feaster or putting on the

60
00:07:44,864 --> 00:07:47,200
bright sides and your placing it

61
00:07:49,631 --> 00:07:52,511
where your marker is and I'm just going to

62
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:58,463
add up into position that for now

63
00:08:07,872 --> 00:08:08,544
I've just

64
00:08:10,303 --> 00:08:12,799
use the sewing machine to tuck it in place

65
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:16,959
but you could just and hand statures well

66
00:08:42,143 --> 00:08:47,296
now we've got this that the last attacks in place I'm now going to place

67
00:08:48,671 --> 00:08:50,783
the other person piece on top of it

68
00:08:54,719 --> 00:08:55,776
and now I'm going to

69
00:08:58,304 --> 00:09:04,320
pin on my case opera please and closing clips and then I'm going to sit all

70
00:09:04,351 --> 00:09:06,848
the way around this long curved back edge

71
00:09:07,872 --> 00:09:10,495
which will form the back of the hair towel turban

72
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:29,471
if you do have an overlocker what you could do instead when you cut it out

73
00:09:29,599 --> 00:09:33,695
you could have the seam allowance so I put half an inch on this which is

74
00:09:33,791 --> 00:09:35,616
one point two sons pieces that you could

75
00:09:36,671 --> 00:09:40,607
reduce that and just use your overlocker and

76
00:09:42,495 --> 00:09:46,656
go round the edge of always you could leave it how it is and allow your

77
00:09:46,719 --> 00:09:50,911
overlocker to trim off so if you do have an overlocker you could just over look

78
00:09:50,976 --> 00:09:55,648
at this stage if you don't and you will need to go into the zone machine

79
00:09:56,607 --> 00:09:58,687
stitch through and then you'll need to neaten

80
00:09:59,903 --> 00:10:01,056
the raw edges after

81
00:10:03,487 --> 00:10:09,216
attentively if you do have an overlocker still by all means ikan as it's quite a

82
00:10:09,504 --> 00:10:16,000
curved edge you're more than welcome to just and use your sewing machine to stitch the

83
00:10:16,096 --> 00:10:22,463
original seam allowance to start with and then you could overlook the ends after which is

84
00:10:22,559 --> 00:10:24,288
what I'm going to do in this case

85
00:10:54,943 --> 00:10:59,583
one thing to note if you are overlooking and you're going to trim these seem allowances

86
00:10:59,744 --> 00:11:07,807
is to just make your markings for the buttonhole a bit clearer this will just help

87
00:11:08,703 --> 00:11:13,984
for aligning as you may end up chopping off the bit where you did market so

88
00:11:14,111 --> 00:11:15,840
I'm just gonna extend find down a bit

89
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:19,711
so that I can see it after I've overlocked

90
00:11:32,127 --> 00:11:37,247
once you've neatened off those dms I would recommend giving that seem a little bit of

91
00:11:37,312 --> 00:11:42,752
a press just though it lies a bit flatter so my overlooking I've just overlooked the

92
00:11:42,848 --> 00:11:47,072
two layers together but I'm just going to ensure that it it presses to one side

93
00:11:47,135 --> 00:11:47,552
before I

94
00:11:49,023 --> 00:11:52,383
Nessen those front those front raw edges

95
00:11:57,023 --> 00:12:02,943
the next step you need to finish off the front rule edges before you and eaten

96
00:12:02,976 --> 00:12:07,231
up this seem so I'm going to use a noble locker because I have one and

97
00:12:07,296 --> 00:12:11,616
if you don't have one if you just use a zigzag stitch just to prevent a

98
00:12:11,648 --> 00:12:12,223
bit of frame

99
00:12:13,632 --> 00:12:14,976
and that's what you need to do next

100
00:12:33,343 --> 00:12:39,359
now that you've eaten up the war edges you will need to press under a half

101
00:12:39,744 --> 00:12:42,624
inch seam allowance for one point to centrepieces

102
00:12:44,223 --> 00:12:47,679
all of the way round and then you'll need to stitch that fairly close to the

103
00:12:47,744 --> 00:12:54,143
raw edge but just dumb be careful of where your elastic is taking outspending health it

104
00:12:55,104 --> 00:13:00,447
aloft to use it might go lower down then you expect you might just want to

105
00:13:00,512 --> 00:13:02,335
adjust where you're searching liners

106
00:14:32,383 --> 00:14:38,400
okay so your health heaven is almost complete their final step is adding the button to

107
00:14:38,528 --> 00:14:43,935
this end so and you should still have a marker and if you transferred it about

108
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:48,479
higher up so I'm going to use that to broccoli gauge where I want to put

109
00:14:50,335 --> 00:14:50,815
the button

110
00:14:52,512 --> 00:14:57,151
have actually changed my mind on buttons while I've been making this so I've now decided

111
00:14:58,367 --> 00:15:00,671
to use a slightly bigger bottom

112
00:15:05,184 --> 00:15:07,392
so the button you want to make sure it's

113
00:15:08,671 --> 00:15:14,559
tied on really secure just because it's going to be holding back that the elastic which

114
00:15:14,687 --> 00:15:16,159
might be quite taught

115
00:15:19,263 --> 00:15:21,984
just bear that in mind so I've been

116
00:15:23,424 --> 00:15:25,247
doubled my neighbor and tied are not

117
00:15:28,671 --> 00:15:32,255
so with a handy to give it a little bit of wiggle room as well so

118
00:15:32,447 --> 00:15:33,632
I'm just going to find

119
00:15:34,976 --> 00:15:35,552
something

120
00:15:40,031 --> 00:15:45,088
in the back okay so thought of walking for gauge underseas the round but

121
00:16:08,544 --> 00:16:10,880
okay so now you have your button in base

122
00:16:30,815 --> 00:16:35,903
hello again so here is the final hair towel turban so I'll just give you a

123
00:16:36,031 --> 00:16:39,296
quick well around see can see it from different angles

124
00:16:42,624 --> 00:16:47,072
so from the back you can see that I've got the button down there as I've

125
00:16:47,104 --> 00:16:50,880
got quite a big head it might be better if I positioned it slightly up so

126
00:16:51,104 --> 00:16:56,383
that would be my main recommendation there I have put where the busing could be placed

127
00:16:56,479 --> 00:17:01,247
on the pattern I'd recommend you know trial and error seeing

128
00:17:02,495 --> 00:17:06,144
you know whoever you're making it for if you're making it for yourself and if you

129
00:17:06,239 --> 00:17:09,567
got a small ahead it probably fine lower down there that if you got a big

130
00:17:09,631 --> 00:17:13,791
ahead like myself you might want it a little bit higher up and you could also

131
00:17:13,952 --> 00:17:18,560
extend the elastic a bit although that will wear out in time so it will become

132
00:17:18,656 --> 00:17:23,104
a bit later and more flexible to this them but elastic I've got there is quite

133
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:27,583
tight but if you use something like that elastic it approve of it has a bit

134
00:17:27,647 --> 00:17:32,927
more gives than this one so although I do feel the button could be a bit

135
00:17:32,991 --> 00:17:37,472
higher up for me I think when the elastic and where's in a bit it won't

136
00:17:37,536 --> 00:17:39,008
be a problem for me anymore

137
00:17:40,031 --> 00:17:44,416
so I'm quite happy with the fear and I have put this on with dry her

138
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:49,280
so it was a bit challenging to put on but if you've got Wester hair I'm

139
00:17:49,375 --> 00:17:54,079
sure be a lot easier and to put your am hair turban on

140
00:17:55,583 --> 00:18:00,671
and another thing to note is and I've got quite long hair so what I do

141
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:08,479
when I put a towel turban on is I've just fold the excess in so I'm

142
00:18:08,671 --> 00:18:13,984
if you got head that's longer than the length of this and that's what I'd recommend

143
00:18:14,079 --> 00:18:14,400
doing

144
00:18:15,552 --> 00:18:19,520
okay that's all I've really got to sonnet see how few do you want to make

145
00:18:19,615 --> 00:18:23,968
this yourself just and click on the link below and you should be able to download

146
00:18:24,063 --> 00:18:27,807
the PCF that I've created for this thanks for watching by
