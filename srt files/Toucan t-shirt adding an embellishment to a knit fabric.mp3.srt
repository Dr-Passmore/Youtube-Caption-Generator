00:00:00,128 --> 00:00:04,352
hello today I'm going to finally get on with my tooth and t-shirts if you like

1
00:00:04,415 --> 00:00:07,711
this video and what might seem or please don't forget to like unsubscribe if you haven't

2
00:00:07,743 --> 00:00:11,744
already a case so the story is that every so often I made up with one

3
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:14,975
my friends to and doesn't live in the UK any more but she comes back a

4
00:00:15,071 --> 00:00:20,128
resultant and we meet at a midpoint between our two locations I think it was in

5
00:00:20,224 --> 00:00:24,000
twenty eighteen it was a really hot summer her in the UK and yeah it's just

6
00:00:24,096 --> 00:00:28,384
really hot and there was a lighter and we thought yeah let's go swimming we didn't

7
00:00:28,416 --> 00:00:34,111
have any stof force women to we grabbed a swimsuit from from bark and a towel

8
00:00:34,624 --> 00:00:38,624
which obviously isn't the best idea and not most the same boy there anyway we did

9
00:00:38,687 --> 00:00:41,855
try the one in the fitting room with the idea that we can then keep these

10
00:00:41,919 --> 00:00:46,015
items they will find in the changing room but augustly we need them again we got

11
00:00:46,048 --> 00:00:51,712
into lido and it just we just found they weren't that appropriate yeah it's just the

12
00:00:51,776 --> 00:00:56,127
way it's cut isn't great yeah it's not one that I've ever won again this women

13
00:00:56,192 --> 00:01:00,992
my local pool the takes video I am going to just show you the part where

14
00:01:01,119 --> 00:01:06,879
I attach this to a t-shirt so I'm going to make the teacher from scratch because

15
00:01:07,456 --> 00:01:10,847
I don't have many plain tops anyway I've got a bit I had a bit of

16
00:01:10,879 --> 00:01:14,463
remnant fabric which I could make a teacher from and I thought I had tried any

17
00:01:14,527 --> 00:01:18,655
Paston as well that's mine using for this is from a beginner's guide to serving with

18
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:22,783
nutted fabrics by Wendy was so here is the book here and I'm going to make

19
00:01:22,879 --> 00:01:27,167
their peak t-shirt from it so the Pete teacher is quite a nice simple belly I

20
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:31,776
rise have got neckband I'm doing the short flute version I've already cut it out in

21
00:01:31,839 --> 00:01:36,384
advance so I'm to add the two can I will need to use the front peace

22
00:01:36,608 --> 00:01:41,791
so here is my front passin peace already to go and here is the swimsuit so

23
00:01:41,888 --> 00:01:44,928
as you can see it's a very jazzy sequence to come on that what I'm going

24
00:01:44,991 --> 00:01:49,152
to do fast is I'm going to cut roughly round the two can because I figure

25
00:01:49,216 --> 00:01:53,919
that I can and attach it to the front PSF or two layers some descended to

26
00:01:54,047 --> 00:01:59,328
pinch the back layer away because I don't want to cut into that one yet

27
00:02:05,536 --> 00:02:10,944
case the next I think I'm going to add some underwear to the back just because

28
00:02:11,072 --> 00:02:14,111
I'm not sure how will it really works with net fabric and that's the main thing

29
00:02:14,143 --> 00:02:14,559
was been put

30
00:02:15,776 --> 00:02:18,111
to me making this talk but I think

31
00:02:19,264 --> 00:02:22,591
if I can get it to roughly stick and it just attaches to start with hopefully

32
00:02:22,656 --> 00:02:24,160
then it should be okay

33
00:02:34,815 --> 00:02:40,384
okay so to attach the wonder where to the first slide I'm going to still put

34
00:02:40,447 --> 00:02:46,304
it up to unassessed while setting to on my iron but hopefully that will work and

35
00:02:46,335 --> 00:02:50,912
I'm also going to protect it with a bit of fabric over the top hopefully that

36
00:02:50,944 --> 00:02:52,992
this will mean it white damage or burn the fabric

37
00:03:00,735 --> 00:03:04,735
in case so it seems to have stuck for okay I think and but a rule

38
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:08,352
and quite surprised at how well it has stuck on I think now I'm going to

39
00:03:08,479 --> 00:03:12,511
trim the edges so that there's not quite so much blew around it I guess I

40
00:03:12,576 --> 00:03:16,768
could have just done actually I'm an oval shape on it so if you are doing

41
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:20,447
this yourself think about that before you cut it out but I think I'm just going

42
00:03:20,479 --> 00:03:25,408
to have to live with that now and and do very close to stick back around

43
00:03:25,472 --> 00:03:25,919
all the corners

44
00:03:32,927 --> 00:03:35,007
okay so I've now got my two-gun

45
00:03:36,095 --> 00:03:38,944
cut out readies I now need to position it which is probably

46
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:45,184
one of the trickier parts so actually it might help this side in the front and

47
00:03:45,216 --> 00:03:46,880
the back pieces together first

48
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:53,695
just going to line up the

49
00:03:55,167 --> 00:03:59,136
shoulder things with the dress on currently wearing

50
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:03,199
and I'm going to roughly work out where to place it

51
00:04:04,223 --> 00:04:08,128
on my top so I guess to be a bit more accurate you could in the

52
00:04:08,192 --> 00:04:12,447
sides of your top as well I'm just going to go to a mirror and in

53
00:04:12,511 --> 00:04:12,768
that one

54
00:04:14,656 --> 00:04:18,528
actually but or I do that I am going to remove the paper backing

55
00:04:20,799 --> 00:04:25,312
okay so I've decided on the rough placement of the top so I just and went

56
00:04:25,343 --> 00:04:28,160
in front of the mirror placed it roughly in them put a pen at the top

57
00:04:28,223 --> 00:04:32,447
of the bottom just to get a rough idea reclines posset I'm now going to do

58
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:35,872
a couple of quick measurements actually just in case it is really going off to one

59
00:04:35,967 --> 00:04:36,575
side or not

60
00:04:39,455 --> 00:04:43,743
okay I'm pretty happy with my place for hunting I'm not going to adjust it at

61
00:04:43,839 --> 00:04:48,928
all and I'm going to carefully press it on income going to do it from the

62
00:04:48,992 --> 00:04:52,415
riverside they want a tarnish or melt the sequence

63
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:58,463
so see today of last Pinson which isn't ideal but I just don't want it to

64
00:04:58,783 --> 00:05:00,735
me and I'm going to put my

65
00:05:03,071 --> 00:05:04,992
bed protecting fabric over the top

66
00:05:10,783 --> 00:05:14,144
little progress they actually it's not that bad at all

67
00:05:15,391 --> 00:05:17,503
most of it has attached

68
00:05:18,623 --> 00:05:23,488
okay so I was touched it you can't probably get away with doing a straight stitch

69
00:05:23,584 --> 00:05:26,911
on this because this to can so

70
00:05:28,032 --> 00:05:33,407
solid that I don't think the fabric would be able to stretch their anyway but I'm

71
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:37,183
not sure I want to risk it I might do a really small six background and

72
00:05:37,216 --> 00:05:41,664
see what that looks like I've got a whole point nido in because then it favoured

73
00:05:41,951 --> 00:05:43,743
I'm just gonna really take my time unless

74
00:05:45,216 --> 00:05:47,808
it is also I don't know I could damage my Nina if I do hit the

75
00:05:47,936 --> 00:05:55,295
sequence I'm not really liking the effect

76
00:05:56,415 --> 00:05:57,984
this looks a bit very just

77
00:05:59,424 --> 00:06:02,496
lock on you can which obviously it is that

78
00:06:03,615 --> 00:06:08,000
I might win it with a straight stitch I'm gonna test out one a different section

79
00:06:08,063 --> 00:06:08,544
of the bed

80
00:06:09,791 --> 00:06:12,127
and I end up I'm thinking what I'd just done

81
00:06:13,471 --> 00:06:14,239
if it works okay

82
00:06:19,648 --> 00:06:25,951
okay so I'm much preparing how it's turning out with the straight stitch and to be

83
00:06:26,111 --> 00:06:32,511
honest I think the stitches popping won't be in issues because of the old backing that

84
00:06:32,575 --> 00:06:33,600
the chickens on

85
00:06:34,656 --> 00:06:38,911
some now going to unpick the bit as exact I did do I'm gonna sit or

86
00:06:38,944 --> 00:06:44,127
lie across and then I'm going to really carefully trim away the excess blue border

87
00:06:58,432 --> 00:07:01,471
is another I've gone all the way around in the streets it I've had a bit

88
00:07:01,536 --> 00:07:06,303
of a play around talking it but I don't think it's going to pop any of

89
00:07:06,335 --> 00:07:10,783
the stitches so I'm really happy with that a lot easier to do street stesse also

90
00:07:11,264 --> 00:07:16,384
way I'm going to trim it is using these duckbill scissors and go we were really

91
00:07:16,447 --> 00:07:17,440
carefully that cuts

92
00:07:18,752 --> 00:07:22,592
your threads all the fabrics so be caught a bit still a bit caught by the

93
00:07:23,135 --> 00:07:25,279
wonder I get it it's feeling we really easily

94
00:07:26,432 --> 00:07:28,032
most people have used underwear knows that

95
00:07:29,951 --> 00:07:31,264
doesn't stay stuck forever

96
00:07:43,424 --> 00:07:45,183
okay so I've got the

97
00:07:46,239 --> 00:07:50,911
to come on the front of the t-shirts so I'm now going to get on and

98
00:07:51,328 --> 00:07:53,951
stitch the rest of the top up I do think it is worth

99
00:07:55,391 --> 00:08:00,768
attaching if you can your embellishment or if you do want to do something like just

100
00:08:00,799 --> 00:08:06,015
on the front during it at the start when all your pieces are flat you could

101
00:08:06,111 --> 00:08:09,888
do it all do you join the shoulder seams I guess that would be to inconvenient

102
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:13,536
for the just and makes it a lot easier for you to just go around the

103
00:08:13,631 --> 00:08:17,503
shape okay so I just go I'll show you the final results so as you can

104
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:23,488
see it's attached to the t-shirts nicely I've left a really been boarded though I guess

105
00:08:23,584 --> 00:08:27,488
of course you could make a wider border if you wanted I think it's what really

106
00:08:27,615 --> 00:08:33,151
well with this particular pattern because it's a nice plain basic t-shirt and so adamantly recommend

107
00:08:33,216 --> 00:08:39,296
passion for in banishing and making it a bit more individual but yeah I'm really happy

108
00:08:39,359 --> 00:08:44,064
with it they just a recap on what worked best for me in this particular situation

109
00:08:44,192 --> 00:08:49,184
although obviously it does depend on your embellishment because it was backed on a really solid

110
00:08:49,919 --> 00:08:54,304
nonmoving backing it did mean that I could do a straight stitch all the way around

111
00:08:54,528 --> 00:08:58,848
and it turned out to look the best obviously if you do have an embellishment that

112
00:08:59,359 --> 00:09:03,359
stretches like the fight broke you may want to put it on a backing to make

113
00:09:03,455 --> 00:09:07,744
it started I did find on this one that the sigs like stitch didn't look brilliant

114
00:09:07,968 --> 00:09:12,703
and I really relieved that straight stitch work because I don't think I would have wanted

115
00:09:13,119 --> 00:09:17,567
because the original swimsuit was in a fabric as well I was able to just leave

116
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:22,719
a raw edge around the in punishment which was really handy so I've caught really close

117
00:09:22,848 --> 00:09:27,231
with those duckbill senses and I think it's come out really well I don't really need

118
00:09:27,263 --> 00:09:32,320
to worry about it frame it is net fabrics tradition do right and finally I think

119
00:09:32,383 --> 00:09:36,736
if you are positioning an embellishment on it off like this it is worth either pinning

120
00:09:36,864 --> 00:09:41,375
attacking all of your things including the side seams because I think you'll just get them

121
00:09:41,664 --> 00:09:48,223
much more accurate idea of the final possession of your evanishment on the front in case

122
00:09:48,671 --> 00:09:52,544
it for this week thanks as always for watching next week I'll be back with a

123
00:09:52,671 --> 00:09:56,544
pattern review or to speak t-shirt by Wendy woods so I'll see you then
