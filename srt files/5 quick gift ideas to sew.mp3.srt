say I'm going to go through five possible quick sewing makes for gifts if you like

1
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:10,592
this video don't forget to I can subscribe so I'm just going to round off by

2
00:00:11,168 --> 00:00:16,256
ideas I've got on quick sewing gifts you can make their role ideas where you can

3
00:00:16,384 --> 00:00:21,055
find a tutorial online so if you're not sure how to create it yourself you'll definitely

4
00:00:21,087 --> 00:00:24,992
be able to find some instruction somewhere on the web I think they're all quite quick

5
00:00:25,120 --> 00:00:28,927
mix as well there is what I'm not completely sure how long it would take but

6
00:00:28,992 --> 00:00:32,576
I just really wanted to add it for some reason it's the first idea is to

7
00:00:32,703 --> 00:00:38,687
make their simple I'm as so there are lots of different three buttons online and also

8
00:00:38,816 --> 00:00:42,080
if you got the firmest so we look at the library you could probably find one

9
00:00:42,144 --> 00:00:46,624
and there as well so I know a particular one that I'm these myself is the

10
00:00:46,687 --> 00:00:51,167
Italian the button is free my last person so there's a really good guided said as

11
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:55,327
a downloadable template if you follow that it won't take you that much time at all

12
00:00:55,423 --> 00:00:58,911
to create one you don't need an awful lot of fabric for a sign or so

13
00:00:58,944 --> 00:01:03,040
you could W's on some scraps if you make that the great thing with the imus

14
00:01:03,167 --> 00:01:06,463
as well as you could combine it in your Christmas yet so good to get them

15
00:01:06,592 --> 00:01:08,704
seven you no trouble at all the treatment or

16
00:01:09,856 --> 00:01:15,263
I don't know it looks just them I guess other items that compliments and I ask

17
00:01:15,295 --> 00:01:19,615
you know I guess the self-care kids it is the idea number two it's also from

18
00:01:19,744 --> 00:01:24,447
Cillian buttons they have a slip of it as an I really want to make this

19
00:01:24,608 --> 00:01:28,031
I haven't made this one and so this is the one where I'm not sure if

20
00:01:28,096 --> 00:01:32,127
it would be I'm really quick make but I just really wants to do it in

21
00:01:32,255 --> 00:01:36,447
some reason and again I think it's quite a good sash buster it doesn't look like

22
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:40,000
you need an awful or fabric to greater if you were making this for someone else

23
00:01:40,064 --> 00:01:43,872
you would need to know their shoes signs that's the main issue I'd say and obviously

24
00:01:43,968 --> 00:01:44,223
I guess

25
00:01:45,248 --> 00:01:50,720
some people might not like that style of slipper but like I say I think it's

26
00:01:50,783 --> 00:01:57,055
a really novel idea it's a bit different and yeah it's a free person so it

27
00:01:57,087 --> 00:02:00,351
would be amazing to give it a go I don't number three it is to make

28
00:02:00,639 --> 00:02:05,183
a head old urban so as you might be aware I've done a tutorial on this

29
00:02:05,279 --> 00:02:09,279
and I've got a downloadable PDA half in which is free on my website but there

30
00:02:09,567 --> 00:02:15,199
are probably lots of other ones available as well or I'm wrong post that could teach

31
00:02:15,231 --> 00:02:18,496
you know how to walk up your own one to your own test again he could

32
00:02:18,559 --> 00:02:23,455
couple some other shop for thousands whether you know you could get some nice to know

33
00:02:23,583 --> 00:02:25,727
toiletries shampooed position of bubble bath

34
00:02:27,231 --> 00:02:32,576
you know any other deconditioning hair treatments all of those words compliment and the heads out

35
00:02:32,639 --> 00:02:38,527
urban really nicely I did member for is the classic Toot's bag so bags really first

36
00:02:38,559 --> 00:02:43,615
little option you can only make one of them most people I think most be more

37
00:02:43,776 --> 00:02:49,216
to be appreciative of one you can obviously personalise it depending on who you're giving it

38
00:02:49,279 --> 00:02:53,888
to or you can make it as neutral was possible if you're not too sure what

39
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:58,623
they're interested in below if you are making a gift for someone I'd hope that you

40
00:02:58,688 --> 00:03:03,360
leave him well enough or that you were close enough to them to be expanding the

41
00:03:03,423 --> 00:03:08,255
time and effort to make a hammock lift so there are absolutely tons of to bag

42
00:03:08,352 --> 00:03:14,240
platens out there and tons of three Hatton's so again it's something that you wouldn't need

43
00:03:14,304 --> 00:03:18,048
to buy a passion for obviously if you want to buy passen that's fine but if

44
00:03:18,175 --> 00:03:20,960
you know you're trying to keep the costs down and you just want something quickly you

45
00:03:21,024 --> 00:03:25,919
can access instantly and for example money makes us got a nice looking to bank which

46
00:03:26,016 --> 00:03:30,207
they broke and he takes twenty minutes which sounds about it but I mean I know

47
00:03:30,367 --> 00:03:35,167
I used a couple of different Tobit patterns online some that you know have the

48
00:03:36,511 --> 00:03:42,975
bottom to it you know rather than just having to front of backpiece stitch together from

49
00:03:43,039 --> 00:03:46,367
the sides that's actually got base as well which will be seemings you can store a

50
00:03:46,432 --> 00:03:51,328
bit more in your bag and again obviously you could potentially and you know you think

51
00:03:51,423 --> 00:03:56,416
I am bag you're giving that person with a to bore item if you want to

52
00:03:56,479 --> 00:04:01,727
do but it's definitely a good one on its own as well and finally I did

53
00:04:01,792 --> 00:04:05,951
number five is to make some thought of the zipper pouch so I've shown a tutorial

54
00:04:05,983 --> 00:04:11,455
on how to make a simple tempest previously so obviously cannot look at that and I've

55
00:04:11,488 --> 00:04:14,848
got a block press which might be a bit easier to follow from the video on

56
00:04:14,912 --> 00:04:20,256
local I expect that relate to different patterns that pouches out there which could help you

57
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:25,088
decides on the style that you like the great thing again about set pouches kind of

58
00:04:25,119 --> 00:04:29,824
goes back to the eye mask and the head tallat heaven but again you could use

59
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:33,696
it as the case for the base for the rest of the gift so I mean

60
00:04:33,727 --> 00:04:36,992
obesely traditionally and you know you put money and a

61
00:04:38,368 --> 00:04:43,200
sip of our Chul pass but what you could do is had some other items that

62
00:04:43,264 --> 00:04:47,455
you want to give them you to create a vanity that you can you know give

63
00:04:47,519 --> 00:04:52,351
some really nice bespoke button and if they're intercross if you made it longer or a

64
00:04:52,415 --> 00:04:56,351
bit bigger you could make a pencil case and add some really nice color and pencils

65
00:04:56,415 --> 00:04:58,911
in there and starts going to obviously I'm

66
00:05:00,287 --> 00:05:05,312
a child at school but it could also be good for anyone who's into mindful coloring

67
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:10,880
it's also a really good idea and for storage if you know they ballance of Croatia

68
00:05:10,944 --> 00:05:15,071
hex they could store their gray shikse in and I stepped pouch it's about it for

69
00:05:15,135 --> 00:05:20,544
tidies video obviously there are absolutely tons of different quicks own makes you can create that

70
00:05:21,023 --> 00:05:25,119
or even quicker than once I've suggested or you know might be a bit more of

71
00:05:25,152 --> 00:05:29,664
a suitable dependency you can to make for but I just thought I'd give a few

72
00:05:29,824 --> 00:05:34,208
just a gettable rolling if you know you're in a something in official what to make

73
00:05:34,463 --> 00:05:37,888
or you know you literally got you know what do you think to make it and

74
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:42,687
do you need to decide fast Pixley that will help well that's it for now thanks

75
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:43,167
for watching
