00:00:00,192 --> 00:00:04,447
hello today I'm excited to share with you some of the craft items I've acquired over

1
00:00:04,512 --> 00:00:08,704
the last two or three months okay so I think I'll start off with the fabric

2
00:00:08,864 --> 00:00:14,336
that's I were quiet so a lot of this is from charity shops I haven't any

3
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:16,927
fabric I'm on the meter for

4
00:00:18,271 --> 00:00:22,624
probably all year actually can I am trying not to buy any fabric so the first

5
00:00:22,687 --> 00:00:22,815
one

6
00:00:24,927 --> 00:00:25,791
is this father

7
00:00:28,959 --> 00:00:31,552
is increased but it's a lovely sort of

8
00:00:33,888 --> 00:00:38,655
its got that crinkled effect I'm assuming it's fantastic and I think that would make a

9
00:00:38,784 --> 00:00:39,807
lovely dress

10
00:00:41,664 --> 00:00:42,368
I'm not important in

11
00:00:45,023 --> 00:00:45,791
the other side of table

12
00:00:47,104 --> 00:00:51,071
next that is this lovely bold floral prints

13
00:00:53,023 --> 00:00:59,391
fairly sure cotton or it's definitely of cotton blend I say yes of this lovely old

14
00:00:59,520 --> 00:00:59,872
print

15
00:01:01,439 --> 00:01:05,503
again I mean there's not a huge amount of fabrics so

16
00:01:06,879 --> 00:01:07,839
that's the widow

17
00:01:08,959 --> 00:01:09,727
pearly-white actually

18
00:01:13,632 --> 00:01:16,255
not quite a meter and a half so

19
00:01:18,272 --> 00:01:21,536
yes it will be interesting to see if I can get something out but obviously would

20
00:01:21,568 --> 00:01:26,720
be lovely it's not all definitely at the scarce out of this so get I'm really

21
00:01:26,847 --> 00:01:31,839
pleased with the spin fabric it came actually the fall from the same charity shop them

22
00:01:32,064 --> 00:01:37,536
somewhat oversee generously donated these fabrics in the next one is this nothing on this one

23
00:01:37,664 --> 00:01:39,744
actually since it is a fine great

24
00:01:41,152 --> 00:01:44,800
love it when they are so which don't you want the of fabric and so as

25
00:01:44,832 --> 00:01:45,599
you can see it's

26
00:01:46,816 --> 00:01:52,319
a lovely black wanting great again this there's actually a fair amount it in this piece

27
00:01:52,416 --> 00:01:56,512
of well I'd say he's fully about a couple of meters so I'm gonna see public

28
00:01:56,575 --> 00:01:57,407
through my patterns

29
00:01:58,783 --> 00:01:59,295
possibly

30
00:02:00,671 --> 00:02:02,208
possibly make dress and

31
00:02:03,935 --> 00:02:07,519
although I've really got into you making blouses since I made the silly in the Aston's

32
00:02:07,583 --> 00:02:09,087
boat laws and I'm also made

33
00:02:10,688 --> 00:02:12,287
and other plans before so

34
00:02:13,535 --> 00:02:17,440
quite tempted I do have some loughs pattens so all have a think about it to

35
00:02:17,472 --> 00:02:19,776
the next one and as a ferret this fabric actually

36
00:02:21,824 --> 00:02:26,432
it's only see I'm being caught up for another project and it's still of navy it

37
00:02:26,496 --> 00:02:31,615
feels really stuffed lacily this again thing it probably is a Carson yeah I have no

38
00:02:31,712 --> 00:02:34,815
idea I'm gonna make with this actually it probably would make my stressed and

39
00:02:37,024 --> 00:02:40,703
makes a nice trousers to be honest and there's probably enough there I'll have to think

40
00:02:40,735 --> 00:02:44,192
about it the next I said this isn't actually from

41
00:02:45,664 --> 00:02:48,287
I don't know this from which I shook my mom gave it's me and

42
00:02:49,376 --> 00:02:55,968
it's either a tablecloth that and city is basically a late stable of so it's either

43
00:02:56,352 --> 00:03:01,888
one that she's owned and no one wants to use or it is

44
00:03:02,912 --> 00:03:06,848
from a china shop and she thought should do something with a hazard so the either

45
00:03:06,912 --> 00:03:11,136
with this I am temp's to keep it as the table loss but I think all

46
00:03:11,199 --> 00:03:11,904
the adventurous

47
00:03:13,503 --> 00:03:17,983
and essentially I want to cut it one of the corners

48
00:03:19,615 --> 00:03:24,447
is used and we need to wash this actually I can't want to make something that

49
00:03:24,511 --> 00:03:25,055
wraps over

50
00:03:27,296 --> 00:03:30,399
white be using a pastor for that I'm going to make up the go along but

51
00:03:30,623 --> 00:03:32,832
they do need to think about how I'm going to

52
00:03:34,335 --> 00:03:38,944
make that work so yeah pretty something I should leasing will the weather still nice and

53
00:03:38,975 --> 00:03:39,039
the

54
00:03:40,063 --> 00:03:44,576
I guess so from that same charity job names they had where I seeing a person's

55
00:03:44,639 --> 00:03:50,304
as well so I was very lucky but several so I got this I'm in its

56
00:03:50,335 --> 00:03:51,423
white a sense of water is

57
00:03:53,535 --> 00:03:59,583
yes is Mrs followers and capelets with trim variation stiff and if you can see there's

58
00:03:59,679 --> 00:04:05,408
I'm some lovely variety to choose from them it is actually not in my size range

59
00:04:05,472 --> 00:04:09,567
but it's only just out with my size range and I'm seeing where people have traded

60
00:04:09,632 --> 00:04:14,623
it down to them so I probably looked into that the next pattern is this new

61
00:04:14,751 --> 00:04:20,000
look to six for double one and if they keep the omit rigid great and so

62
00:04:20,096 --> 00:04:23,200
on this one actually recommends the crate

63
00:04:25,503 --> 00:04:27,808
what I like about this is it does have

64
00:04:29,727 --> 00:04:34,079
it doesn't have sessions leaves they look more right and shape yeah it looks like a

65
00:04:34,111 --> 00:04:40,511
really nice simple make and that all good to making a look more like a wintry

66
00:04:41,376 --> 00:04:45,536
pattens the next one I was very excited when I found this it is the true

67
00:04:45,696 --> 00:04:50,432
but create beginner person so and she I think I might have been thinking of making

68
00:04:51,424 --> 00:04:56,096
this with the black fine great not complete you to all the like I say

69
00:04:58,079 --> 00:05:03,007
yeah just it looks really nice that's the problem neck by institute from so that's like

70
00:05:03,071 --> 00:05:07,071
a skims bronze neckline and the little service we hope neckline

71
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:14,623
the sash around the waist I think this would be lovely again probably best told a

72
00:05:14,687 --> 00:05:17,951
big somewhere on winter cool seasons really the naked

73
00:05:19,071 --> 00:05:20,287
make it warmed by wearing

74
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:26,559
you know types with it so yeah I'm really looking forward to trying this person out

75
00:05:26,656 --> 00:05:31,007
I'm not sure I try to let them actually I thought about trying and testing that

76
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:36,191
with the breed and they've got that soul better talk I looked into making that by

77
00:05:36,608 --> 00:05:39,359
then I made it sick haven't started it all

78
00:05:40,799 --> 00:05:43,231
so yeah I look voice trying out that person

79
00:05:44,671 --> 00:05:46,335
the next one is

80
00:05:47,743 --> 00:05:52,895
simplicity ten eighteen I got when I pasted this on Instagram itchily I got a lot

81
00:05:52,959 --> 00:05:58,432
of comments that people really liked this pattern so it kind of looks quite like my

82
00:05:58,528 --> 00:06:02,847
style as well I'm and I'm probably used up some scraps looks like there's a nice

83
00:06:02,944 --> 00:06:08,704
bit of you know you using different passing combinations together to make this or you know

84
00:06:08,959 --> 00:06:14,976
it works well in the fullness sleep anyway so deeply it will work with whatever fabric

85
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:19,967
five brought in my stash he'll be that different anyway even it happen I've got is

86
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:24,320
the simplicity Kate one tree seven see this is some ple stk ate one of three

87
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:30,976
seven again and and lovely-looking wrap dress and there's also a top variation so having a

88
00:06:31,071 --> 00:06:32,832
little again actually this would work with

89
00:06:33,855 --> 00:06:37,247
a lot of the fabrics I've just showed you so again quite something I just have

90
00:06:37,312 --> 00:06:39,839
to check on the amount of fabric you need because

91
00:06:41,696 --> 00:06:47,455
it looks like you need a fair amount of during the room dress so I'm not

92
00:06:49,951 --> 00:06:53,343
I would have enough for all of these but again it's always worth even straight out

93
00:06:53,376 --> 00:06:57,119
of all the person leasable camass and you might still be up to fit them in

94
00:06:57,183 --> 00:07:04,511
the fabric by tweaking the pass and layout right the next one really quite the

95
00:07:05,951 --> 00:07:10,880
on this one as well is the anarchist tunic my simple so I really like the

96
00:07:10,944 --> 00:07:14,880
look of death again I'm thinking possibly for the autumn winter

97
00:07:15,903 --> 00:07:21,727
and then at the moment because it is really warm and it actually takes my mother's

98
00:07:21,791 --> 00:07:24,000
dash within again they are from a charity shop to

99
00:07:25,376 --> 00:07:26,687
got a couple of fabric choices for

100
00:07:30,432 --> 00:07:36,096
which is nice I'm from within its but very think so square Jack define it

101
00:07:37,567 --> 00:07:40,511
which I think would go quite nicely with it

102
00:07:43,135 --> 00:07:44,063
I've also got

103
00:07:45,119 --> 00:07:46,272
this fabric which I think

104
00:07:47,359 --> 00:07:52,992
would be really nice however it's in the left fabric and I'm not sure how that

105
00:07:53,055 --> 00:07:58,015
would affect the pattern because it is designed for woven I mean it's quite a stable

106
00:07:59,455 --> 00:08:01,440
was like quite disable it

107
00:08:02,656 --> 00:08:08,544
and then Stephanie in a fabric hair but I look really sure I might just use

108
00:08:08,608 --> 00:08:09,055
this for

109
00:08:10,144 --> 00:08:14,720
and its past Incas' its face that I've got enough of them by still want to

110
00:08:14,783 --> 00:08:18,847
make so so yeah I'm gonna think about that is this one person that I got

111
00:08:19,295 --> 00:08:24,223
from that charity shop and that is it so that was clearly stuck up the months

112
00:08:24,256 --> 00:08:28,575
scope when I went at him it's the Juliet tieback about another simple say one and

113
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:34,687
another one on and from that people commented was a nice make it looks nice and

114
00:08:34,719 --> 00:08:39,200
simple which it took from simple thing now I did get more Cassian's over the last

115
00:08:39,231 --> 00:08:42,239
couple of months so my partner I think the next time

116
00:08:43,487 --> 00:08:45,247
we traveled to the sound he then

117
00:08:46,335 --> 00:08:50,080
he went to get a haircut because he doesn't like it lit up in call me

118
00:08:50,176 --> 00:08:54,880
where we are and just gussy isn't found a bothers that he really like I said

119
00:08:55,455 --> 00:08:59,520
he got his hair caught once in the sound and now he just weeks tilting back

120
00:08:59,616 --> 00:09:02,559
and in the area to get her cot against so

121
00:09:03,711 --> 00:09:07,744
I guess we'll have to visit every couple of months to make sure that it doesn't

122
00:09:07,776 --> 00:09:08,159
get really

123
00:09:09,375 --> 00:09:13,312
anyway so if you got two persons the first ones bird is seven and three seven

124
00:09:13,408 --> 00:09:19,520
three and which is there's a top of the scope Darien and address not quite high

125
00:09:19,648 --> 00:09:20,736
neckline and

126
00:09:21,919 --> 00:09:25,408
but I quite like the style so I think I would like how to go about

127
00:09:25,567 --> 00:09:27,583
so I'm and he also found

128
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:34,911
the seven for eight nine and which is another wrap-up addressed by the looks of it

129
00:09:35,903 --> 00:09:36,031
so

130
00:09:37,823 --> 00:09:39,807
the one I could use that and I'm grateful

131
00:09:40,992 --> 00:09:44,799
I'm sure it work with some of the other fabrics as well answer that I did

132
00:09:44,927 --> 00:09:49,280
find some patterns locally as well in a charts show and probably only last week actually

133
00:09:50,559 --> 00:09:53,760
so I got a nice and I've got a long one on the way no

134
00:09:57,919 --> 00:10:02,111
children I picked up a fairly tackety looking

135
00:10:04,159 --> 00:10:09,695
copy of McCalls printed out and seven seven eight three and which is a big side

136
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:10,976
so I can only make the

137
00:10:12,159 --> 00:10:13,375
one denied to age three

138
00:10:15,072 --> 00:10:18,719
this is something else I faced it all in scrab about and I don't realize till

139
00:10:18,752 --> 00:10:25,440
I came home that this passage or says suitable kitchen and in the bottom corner it's

140
00:10:25,504 --> 00:10:27,007
very small but um yeah

141
00:10:28,159 --> 00:10:31,552
I didn't she noted that on this one first is because I noticed it on

142
00:10:33,536 --> 00:10:38,687
one of the other passengers Yep so I will say what the Macau's nineteen for nine

143
00:10:38,783 --> 00:10:41,375
printed method which is another dress

144
00:10:42,559 --> 00:10:46,880
but this one at the bottom is not suitable for traffic this snow and that breaks

145
00:10:46,911 --> 00:10:48,127
from the nineteen of sixties

146
00:10:49,567 --> 00:10:50,271
explains

147
00:10:52,159 --> 00:10:52,544
a lot

148
00:10:54,624 --> 00:10:56,671
fortunately things have changed these days

149
00:10:58,848 --> 00:11:02,080
yeah they are all twelve the fact they felt that they could

150
00:11:03,231 --> 00:11:07,903
print that the person and has even a beside the one that in suit but which

151
00:11:07,935 --> 00:11:11,744
Abby suddenly how you can address the person for the for the top of your child

152
00:11:12,575 --> 00:11:20,768
Ya-Ya interesting so actually I've already made a spots on this passen the one souple creature

153
00:11:20,864 --> 00:11:27,552
me and I'm doing variation see witches if you can see there's a top and short

154
00:11:27,616 --> 00:11:32,864
aspersion so I thought that would be nice for my niece putties around that age and

155
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:36,351
I had a nice fabric that I got a while ago in from hobby crying about

156
00:11:36,383 --> 00:11:41,440
a year ago this cabin it takes Peter to think through my fabric traces and the

157
00:11:41,504 --> 00:11:45,888
can hide in all my love refashions like so yeah so far it's a really simple

158
00:11:45,952 --> 00:11:51,231
make actually I'm so the shorts a lot of complicated than you think that's got a

159
00:11:51,296 --> 00:11:52,192
front waistband

160
00:11:53,599 --> 00:11:58,687
and then its last cases in the back sections of the shorts it's also got

161
00:12:02,528 --> 00:12:05,728
yet it's got a plate on either side of the front piece of the shops as

162
00:12:05,823 --> 00:12:05,984
well

163
00:12:07,039 --> 00:12:07,583
and the

164
00:12:08,927 --> 00:12:12,159
and at the top has got a sit in the back in the center back so

165
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:17,984
so yeah bit more involved than I thought it would be all they saying that it's

166
00:12:18,559 --> 00:12:23,200
um sewing up really quick which is great because I haven't seen anything I'm recently for

167
00:12:23,263 --> 00:12:27,104
a bit so it's helping me get back into sewing and also I'm using a really

168
00:12:27,168 --> 00:12:31,424
stable kosten so I'm not having many issues at all the lockers like I'm fine I

169
00:12:31,487 --> 00:12:32,159
mean such would

170
00:12:33,599 --> 00:12:37,119
hopefully it will carry on the unfined so yes so then

171
00:12:38,656 --> 00:12:44,927
you the one more suitable Tommy's and has different address versions will ever you make this

172
00:12:44,992 --> 00:12:46,367
August think will be a little bit

173
00:12:47,552 --> 00:12:48,031
for my niece

174
00:12:50,752 --> 00:12:53,728
here then there's this other one is why which she had a lower place in the

175
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:59,263
front and papillae so yes in this one's buster it five three six to there's no

176
00:12:59,359 --> 00:13:03,424
reference and I'll bake the time but let's just say that and then you I did

177
00:13:03,487 --> 00:13:04,512
get a couple of

178
00:13:05,823 --> 00:13:11,679
adult pattens so I got this dress which I spot a nice and band at the

179
00:13:11,744 --> 00:13:13,343
top at the neckline

180
00:13:14,495 --> 00:13:16,927
and Oh yes this is the past that I was

181
00:13:18,304 --> 00:13:23,007
also thinking of making as she is not and then one either better sheet might go

182
00:13:23,104 --> 00:13:23,616
nice with the

183
00:13:25,119 --> 00:13:31,807
oval of fabric I should previously like nicely with this fabric is this

184
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:37,888
simplicity eight to hate to see from nineteen sixty night

185
00:13:39,007 --> 00:13:44,064
so yeah I think that would be really nice again probably more autumn winter-time but yeah

186
00:13:44,255 --> 00:13:48,895
I really would like to make that one their necks licensing gonna show a ones that

187
00:13:49,504 --> 00:13:51,168
been given to me I'm due to

188
00:13:52,544 --> 00:13:55,424
and someone clearing out for this lovely item

189
00:13:58,719 --> 00:14:02,528
I have tried on I think what I will do boat is I'm going to I'm

190
00:14:02,591 --> 00:14:06,047
in a tenant something else as I ah probably cost it up maybe undo the scenes

191
00:14:07,392 --> 00:14:11,679
I really like the fabric and I think how it currently is I probably make their

192
00:14:11,711 --> 00:14:16,575
long he saw them but I would devotee get his elbows something else with this fabric

193
00:14:17,375 --> 00:14:21,216
and and it's a lovely front it did run a lot though when I watched it

194
00:14:21,280 --> 00:14:24,607
so I'll have to keep that in mind I also got a couple of house

195
00:14:26,463 --> 00:14:31,872
so with these I would like to make one of those cover-up things like a penguins

196
00:14:31,935 --> 00:14:35,328
our group is from a book called made for baby

197
00:14:36,927 --> 00:14:40,064
I first pneumatic setting is in a magazine I'd bought and they have the past in

198
00:14:40,096 --> 00:14:44,960
them but I can't find the page you get little the templates on so I reserved

199
00:14:44,992 --> 00:14:48,575
it in the library so that I can get the person visas so you can to

200
00:14:48,607 --> 00:14:51,104
make that for my new knees who is due to

201
00:14:52,383 --> 00:14:56,703
I'm not sure if these tales of wideness the that's the only problem I do have

202
00:14:56,768 --> 00:15:01,823
a bit of white toweling left over from when I make it my head out urban

203
00:15:01,919 --> 00:15:05,728
which is another video that you can watch where you have a maker and you can

204
00:15:05,791 --> 00:15:07,840
found this pattern on my websites

205
00:15:09,343 --> 00:15:13,599
yeah I will say god to moments of yellow so I'm thinking I'm probably gonna make

206
00:15:14,015 --> 00:15:17,952
it looked like a pinguin just one person and but yeah high clocker with that seen

207
00:15:18,143 --> 00:15:21,856

209
00:15:28,383 --> 00:15:33,184

210
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:39,840

211
00:15:39,872 --> 00:15:44,544
it spend wide snake I probably does me in the project with this I thought about

212
00:15:44,927 --> 00:15:47,296
