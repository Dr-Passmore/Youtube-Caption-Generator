00:00:00,287 --> 00:00:03,328
I know today we're going to do a quick catch up to say what we've been

1
00:00:03,391 --> 00:00:06,527
up to him may as always if you like this video and light Seymour please I

2
00:00:06,656 --> 00:00:10,527
forget to like unsubscribe if you haven't already and a call this episode we try the

3
00:00:10,592 --> 00:00:13,119
lockdown I need a haircut I think you're trying to

4
00:00:14,144 --> 00:00:15,616
tempt me and to get in your hand

5
00:00:19,104 --> 00:00:23,360
a little bit wary about it it's not that I'm too concerned it away because you

6
00:00:23,392 --> 00:00:28,832
know your halver is really quite unit you wish this get a razor and I just

7
00:00:29,055 --> 00:00:33,759
share it off with a saying that you do look quite one when you have it

8
00:00:33,888 --> 00:00:34,880
cut pretty holding

9
00:00:36,256 --> 00:00:41,599
on to avoid the earth about the selection you lost a journal I guess when you

10
00:00:41,664 --> 00:00:45,568
have a shorter her style it obviously starts to get out of shape a bit quicker

11
00:00:45,791 --> 00:00:47,007
which cut into my use

12
00:00:51,712 --> 00:01:00,127
you could have a guest ensure that ladle you to stay besides not casting our hair

13
00:01:00,479 --> 00:01:05,632
actually yuccas I think did I cut my friends every money yeah I got that really

14
00:01:05,727 --> 00:01:09,791
sure it's actually grown out okay but that was pretty about two weeks where it was

15
00:01:09,856 --> 00:01:14,080
invariably short and I just get trying to flatten it down with a head and the

16
00:01:14,624 --> 00:01:18,463
finally what to a point where I can live with it again I haven't done much

17
00:01:18,688 --> 00:01:21,791
garment making I don't know why I'm having a real block with sewing

18
00:01:22,912 --> 00:01:29,407
during this look down the delicious yeah sure I found listing and cratering a lot easier

19
00:01:29,664 --> 00:01:33,856
I think it's good like and just sit down and watch something and they've also been

20
00:01:33,919 --> 00:01:40,671
quite simple projects so I've been listening the art netting through which I think I worked

21
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:44,736
out I got in possibly two thousand and six

22
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:52,319
so it's a very standing project and it's obviously taken me over ten years to complete

23
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:56,223
and I finally made it which is amazing so we watched a lot of marble film

24
00:01:56,351 --> 00:02:01,120
for more like veena missing away at it I finally get all this was done and

25
00:02:01,152 --> 00:02:04,288
then what you do is once you've saved them all up see you so then brooks

26
00:02:04,351 --> 00:02:04,639
and line

27
00:02:05,664 --> 00:02:10,783
and then so those books and I together once you finally got all of them sooner

28
00:02:10,975 --> 00:02:16,800
you then double kosher around in one color and then do an outer color as well

29
00:02:17,279 --> 00:02:20,447
and then that's it so this is the final

30
00:02:28,768 --> 00:02:32,703
yeah hasn't been blocks which you probably tell that but I kind of figured it's probably

31
00:02:32,735 --> 00:02:35,968
gonna go on a chair and get crushed anyway

32
00:02:37,888 --> 00:02:41,376
so yeah it's been quite a from project I had to make up a couple of

33
00:02:41,408 --> 00:02:45,376
the square there's a square down here it was one of that seventy-something squares and obviously

34
00:02:45,472 --> 00:02:49,184
last the issue which told you how to make it it's got this sort of ilet

35
00:02:49,472 --> 00:02:51,391
panel on it but

36
00:02:52,639 --> 00:02:55,231
I just worked out how to do in the end I looked at the picture I

37
00:02:55,264 --> 00:03:01,376
had like this tiny long inch he know Richard was an inch big this square showing

38
00:03:01,632 --> 00:03:07,231
because I had the instructions on the order of how to sew up the bottom panel

39
00:03:08,063 --> 00:03:12,447
but I didn't have the instructions for the smile but I did have a preview of

40
00:03:12,511 --> 00:03:17,343
the square so I used that to work out how many stitches passed on and how

41
00:03:17,503 --> 00:03:17,632
to

42
00:03:18,975 --> 00:03:24,511
then make this particular square the answer it's finally done in Tibet and diplomatic actually finishing

43
00:03:24,576 --> 00:03:29,024
up well just been going on for so long and then I think to be honest

44
00:03:29,376 --> 00:03:33,983
because I was really ecstatic when I finished the toilets on our sofa which is all

45
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:38,623
the random array of colors it's all the same square it's a crocheted through

46
00:03:39,647 --> 00:03:42,272
but I think it is felt a bit more individual

47
00:03:43,296 --> 00:03:47,488
know where is this feels very I mean we see it still quite random all of

48
00:03:47,552 --> 00:03:51,615
the square already different and it is nice but I guess

49
00:03:53,119 --> 00:03:57,472
if I designed that it probably wouldn't have let like this when I think this is

50
00:03:57,600 --> 00:04:02,335
also help give you going guarantee locked down so he was more TV in films for

51
00:04:02,399 --> 00:04:07,136
making this and when he came to enter like cardinals didn't pay attention was inside yeah

52
00:04:08,192 --> 00:04:12,095
I got to the end of their stead my and then it will say coincided with

53
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:16,032
had a couple of days of work right by the bank holiday and then it got

54
00:04:16,096 --> 00:04:20,000
to Tuesday after the bank holiday I'd finished this the night before

55
00:04:21,023 --> 00:04:25,376
there was a lot of work going on at work and I just completely lost the

56
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:25,760
plot

57
00:04:30,592 --> 00:04:34,335
a very stressful day they picked up after that but I did so many projects

58
00:04:37,888 --> 00:04:42,463
yes that's that so I'm really happy that's finally done and yet it's just a big

59
00:04:42,528 --> 00:04:44,256
achievement I've never knitted hole through

60
00:04:46,592 --> 00:04:47,135
that's creation

61
00:04:50,559 --> 00:04:55,007
so what as we did that for as Bihari camera we're gonna promising him that we

62
00:04:55,167 --> 00:05:00,351
mentioned in the last video yet we've ever done that just isn't any gang as though

63
00:05:00,447 --> 00:05:04,575
it's an we just need to point up on the ceiling and get a new and

64
00:05:04,608 --> 00:05:09,536
memory Collot which had a larger capacity I get some of the SD card and I

65
00:05:09,664 --> 00:05:13,440
claimed to the SD card that was in it and put it across the time to

66
00:05:13,503 --> 00:05:14,687
try to gigabytes great

67
00:05:15,712 --> 00:05:20,320
downside to that was the camera the white let my camera to the pie was loose

68
00:05:21,023 --> 00:05:24,864
and it managed to short-circuit the camera adl some of this in the back because the

69
00:05:24,895 --> 00:05:27,104
senses been added Amadou and and get her basement and

70
00:05:28,191 --> 00:05:30,432
probably just a faulty unit he probably shunner done that

71
00:05:32,096 --> 00:05:37,055
woops isn't ready to get one to the Camry in the desert I have no to

72
00:05:38,623 --> 00:05:38,944
be a week

73
00:05:40,575 --> 00:05:47,488
ago feels quite disappointed with that after having such a success for that getting it working

74
00:05:47,648 --> 00:05:53,600
when he had some issues with their cunning and then yeah we're back to waiting for

75
00:05:53,696 --> 00:05:58,623
a new Campbell all the yes as we do another tech maintenance at home on a

76
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:04,384
day off from smiling an ID there's something I have finally created which has been on

77
00:06:04,447 --> 00:06:08,704
my to-do list for absolutely ages and not sure which catch up I brought it up

78
00:06:08,799 --> 00:06:12,384
in before my brought it up in a couple of gadgets it might be in life

79
00:06:12,447 --> 00:06:18,976
everyone and in its in one from months again I don't remember when I took custody

80
00:06:19,104 --> 00:06:19,424
of this

81
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:24,959
to say back-story even that really said it later times when I've mentioned it before going

82
00:06:25,023 --> 00:06:29,279
yeah I'm going to recover it I got this path from my mom he got it

83
00:06:29,312 --> 00:06:35,584
from a charity shop and she intended to recover it she hadn't go around to it

84
00:06:35,679 --> 00:06:39,488
so she went Hey do you want to do and I went yeah sure and she

85
00:06:39,584 --> 00:06:43,488
tucked in a couple of different fabrics with her and if I went back to call

86
00:06:43,552 --> 00:06:48,735
more with this person and it sat one on the floor and our flat in various

87
00:06:48,799 --> 00:06:53,536
places but absolutely agents in front of her yes so I finally got around to it

88
00:06:54,015 --> 00:06:57,984
was it last week and Yep so it was kind of in tandem with you making

89
00:06:58,111 --> 00:06:58,656
the camera

90
00:06:59,967 --> 00:07:03,167
and had so I made it so it used to be the sort of like that

91
00:07:03,295 --> 00:07:08,671
deep color in a whole new Hamrick the road around it yeah I had a with

92
00:07:08,768 --> 00:07:11,872
bit of group stringing stuff but then it was to have some cord around it

93
00:07:13,664 --> 00:07:17,152
and I'll do a full video on it but in short if I am picked him

94
00:07:17,247 --> 00:07:23,584
essentially it's an old leather purse there when they'd stockholding over it and then recovered it

95
00:07:23,648 --> 00:07:25,216
themselves not to future

96
00:07:26,623 --> 00:07:30,048
yes he does I undid I was like wow I want to create a cover so

97
00:07:30,111 --> 00:07:34,272
I never have to see the underneath of this ever again I mean was perfectly fine

98
00:07:34,656 --> 00:07:40,032
it's just old and augustly quanti pickling that way but anyway long story she finally got

99
00:07:40,096 --> 00:07:41,503
up recovered so

100
00:07:42,623 --> 00:07:44,032
here's a bit from a pretty furnace

101
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:50,208
main problem with ease and calicoes than its showing up any doubt on our floor but

102
00:07:50,335 --> 00:07:50,976
here it is

103
00:07:53,312 --> 00:07:57,216
and it's got the slide panel of precious where's which go with the grocer's through did

104
00:07:58,144 --> 00:08:02,976
the cattle that front goes without a low purr and we've got a much bigger on

105
00:08:03,743 --> 00:08:05,727
which I also got from mom Atchley

106
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:08,575
so I just I just take him

107
00:08:09,855 --> 00:08:10,783
to summon

108
00:08:11,903 --> 00:08:15,712
yeah and but anyway so she had to I think it was an old iki across

109
00:08:15,776 --> 00:08:22,944
them and we've got a larger but larger so of this cat on the other person

110
00:08:23,007 --> 00:08:27,231
so we focused on the giant cat of the only one large account on this time

111
00:08:27,295 --> 00:08:27,391
of

112
00:08:28,415 --> 00:08:33,504
cotton fabric because it wasn't that big so we faced on getting it central on the

113
00:08:33,599 --> 00:08:37,695
other path and this was a number of years ago I wanted to add another cat

114
00:08:37,856 --> 00:08:40,288
for this one but it turns out we only has

115
00:08:41,471 --> 00:08:46,463
we only had one full cats left on the panel of fabric which was this one

116
00:08:46,559 --> 00:08:50,943
but I think the fabric cut off maybe I'll pale that so I can have used

117
00:08:51,007 --> 00:08:56,992
it to cover the whole of the top it so I reversed the piquet a little

118
00:08:57,151 --> 00:09:01,440
window here to show it but underneath this so I've got a family at the top

119
00:09:01,536 --> 00:09:03,263
and a panel in at the bottom

120
00:09:04,512 --> 00:09:09,760
and then I've got the crew shirt squares though I've crocin it ineffectively but underneath I

121
00:09:09,823 --> 00:09:11,968
have created a whole cover in calico

122
00:09:12,992 --> 00:09:16,544
as I say I never have to look at me in its of it ever again

123
00:09:16,703 --> 00:09:20,607
so yeah so that was a big achievement and yet I'll explain a bit more about

124
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:26,143
the construction probably in the next video they I'm really happy that this is only done

125
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:31,039
and it makes me very happy so a bit different to the throne because I do

126
00:09:31,168 --> 00:09:36,351
for like this is very this is a lot more personal and a bit but unique

127
00:09:36,736 --> 00:09:41,888
start moving on to what I'm fixing on so I was doing a textiles course before

128
00:09:42,367 --> 00:09:47,679
three pandemic and obviously that kind of got canceled so I haven't really based on an

129
00:09:47,744 --> 00:09:52,544
awful up because I'm there's been an awful up the things to do what was when

130
00:09:52,575 --> 00:09:56,127
quite tired but I'm doing a bit ico printing without the water and share a bit

131
00:09:56,159 --> 00:10:00,223
of that soon the other project I was also doing a garment making false the mist

132
00:10:00,736 --> 00:10:06,143
which will say your canceled technically that one would have finished by now but I again

133
00:10:06,208 --> 00:10:09,791
I haven't got around to make in the garment I got there I got a bit

134
00:10:09,919 --> 00:10:15,616
and flustered on a particular instruction and I wasn't sure how to continue the project because

135
00:10:15,679 --> 00:10:19,935
I was lining the dress I think I have mentioned it before in a video but

136
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:23,552
I'm not sure of showing the person there just in case I haven't I got it

137
00:10:23,616 --> 00:10:23,776
here

138
00:10:24,799 --> 00:10:29,375
so it is the NCIC very one three new look and it looks like it came

139
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:33,791
with so magazine so I'll make the dress and I'm making it else of

140
00:10:36,895 --> 00:10:40,960
this is what we see a bit I've got left over so it drapes really nicely

141
00:10:41,151 --> 00:10:45,056
time but it does mean it's quite a tricky fabric to work with its quite slippery

142
00:10:45,184 --> 00:10:51,872
so I finally got around to having a go up making it again and I managed

143
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:56,031
to snag one of the sleeves so I managed to

144
00:10:57,408 --> 00:11:01,216
make an error on one of the sleeves I had to report it so this is

145
00:11:01,312 --> 00:11:06,880
the original sleep which I had to replace and basically what happened is I didn't realize

146
00:11:07,135 --> 00:11:12,288
that the tip of my sewing machine needle had snapped off a little when this happened

147
00:11:12,799 --> 00:11:17,408
or whether it happened just then but what is done is because it was obviously stabbing

148
00:11:17,471 --> 00:11:22,591
a blunt but a metal down into the fabric it caused all these drug lines through

149
00:11:22,687 --> 00:11:28,799
the fabric and it just didn't look good I'd ever see it was already impairing wishes

150
00:11:28,864 --> 00:11:30,335
and its you say

151
00:11:31,359 --> 00:11:36,255
to you so I promptly changed the air so much she needed I finally worked out

152
00:11:37,247 --> 00:11:41,247
where I was stuck it's just I guess there's an extra element trying to think about

153
00:11:41,312 --> 00:11:42,559
how it works with the lining

154
00:11:43,616 --> 00:11:48,031
but it brought me with her the entity anyway some persevering without having to share that

155
00:11:48,096 --> 00:11:52,544
soon so let me be up to and the final day of that to recently is

156
00:11:52,671 --> 00:11:57,695
I've been doing a little bit of weaving so as we mentioned had a hello moment

157
00:11:57,760 --> 00:12:02,080
when I finished the throat and needed something else that I could do I am well

158
00:12:02,176 --> 00:12:06,559
sitting on the sofa so I picked up because I've got lead to you know when

159
00:12:06,591 --> 00:12:10,304
you get magazine and then you get the free gift and then you go here that

160
00:12:10,432 --> 00:12:13,088
free gifts great I'll do that at some point and then you never get around to

161
00:12:13,151 --> 00:12:18,559
it so I've got three Ziploc bags full of thanks sort of projects so I thought

162
00:12:18,624 --> 00:12:22,463
I'd have a look in one of those and pick our project because I'm I think

163
00:12:22,528 --> 00:12:25,119
I mentioned in my make line so the unknitting three is one of I make nine

164
00:12:25,375 --> 00:12:29,760
and the shawl I made my mom was the second young based project so of actually

165
00:12:29,823 --> 00:12:31,872
done both your own based

166
00:12:33,247 --> 00:12:35,072
hand waste products

167
00:12:36,127 --> 00:12:39,968
so they're all done and I didn't actually really have an agenda and what the next

168
00:12:40,031 --> 00:12:42,880
one is there are lots things I want to make but there was nothing I was

169
00:12:44,575 --> 00:12:51,903
starting yeah so which one is this from so this is from issue fifty eight which

170
00:12:51,968 --> 00:12:56,351
is probably years ago because I only got Molly makes for a brief well

171
00:12:57,504 --> 00:12:59,552
I never quite a while ago it's a little weaving loom

172
00:13:00,799 --> 00:13:04,416
and you kind of makeup she go along so it it gives you a starting point

173
00:13:04,479 --> 00:13:09,504
she quit the tassels that was some and told you have to make the first section

174
00:13:10,304 --> 00:13:13,440
of gray but then it kind of days just to know make it up now one

175
00:13:13,567 --> 00:13:17,247
say that's what I've been doing so I've added another testily section

176
00:13:18,335 --> 00:13:22,047
for he carried on for a little bit then add a couple of other colors and

177
00:13:22,239 --> 00:13:27,231
then essentially go to the top you put it on a little wooden doubt apparently it

178
00:13:27,296 --> 00:13:30,367
came with one in the kick but it's not in that so obviously I got this

179
00:13:30,432 --> 00:13:34,719
she skips so I got really complain and it was a every guest anyway and yeah

180
00:13:34,783 --> 00:13:40,127
and then you can hang it someone much so much I found this really therapeutic it's

181
00:13:40,192 --> 00:13:45,184
quite nice to do something where I haven't got a big plan and it's not it's

182
00:13:45,247 --> 00:13:53,408
not for anyone it's just yeah exactly so it's been really enjoyable to have that and

183
00:13:53,599 --> 00:13:58,815
again it's something that I can just do as we watch something on TV say this

184
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:04,864
one has been a nice the break between more intense projects and so what are your

185
00:14:04,895 --> 00:14:05,760
plans for June

186
00:14:06,848 --> 00:14:12,416
survive some items Britain you in which

187
00:14:14,111 --> 00:14:16,544
well I guess what Ilan's for June it is to get the cameras that was the

188
00:14:16,607 --> 00:14:21,471
among your premises will be above all the energy right say my plans for Jean Oh

189
00:14:21,567 --> 00:14:26,943
yes all your friends for June Sri my plans are to get that rest on your

190
00:14:27,072 --> 00:14:30,624
sootily in the next couple of days it is it's been doing me on a bed

191
00:14:30,815 --> 00:14:36,320
so I want to finish my yellow dress I've probably finished the weaving loom thing because

192
00:14:37,567 --> 00:14:40,768
I can imagine I've got quite a bit so far and it's only been the last

193
00:14:40,799 --> 00:14:44,607
few days so I can imagine that that will probably get completed alike as they didn't

194
00:14:44,671 --> 00:14:48,127
have a set target with that I'm probably going to decide on my next young based

195
00:14:48,192 --> 00:14:52,927
project possibly like a bully Philip box and left a be on from my black cardigan

196
00:14:53,216 --> 00:14:53,632
closer

197
00:14:54,687 --> 00:14:58,848
and also because it's the summer it's easier to neck with black young man is the

198
00:14:58,911 --> 00:15:01,184
light levels develop Oh yeah the selling weekender

199
00:15:02,559 --> 00:15:06,335
so that's in a couple of weeks which I might do and so yeah if you

200
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:10,656
haven't seen that the fold line have advertised it so this is the demon on my

201
00:15:10,783 --> 00:15:14,815
best one so as many people can sign up as they want to

202
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,976
say and all the proxy's go to charity

203
00:15:23,263 --> 00:15:24,288
event Bradamante

204
00:15:25,504 --> 00:15:30,367
just not see you that it sounds like what could I dig cineole we can't focus

205
00:15:30,432 --> 00:15:34,880
the you basically set up your computer set up your sewing machine and then you attend

206
00:15:34,943 --> 00:15:38,976
sessions online and get on with the project which is essentially what they do at the

207
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:43,552
in-person events that because it's looking unlikely that is going to go ahead they've decided to

208
00:15:43,616 --> 00:15:49,216
push it forward and make it remote the that might be on the cards a couple

209
00:15:49,280 --> 00:15:49,471
weeks

210
00:15:51,007 --> 00:15:54,752
and see you are probably choose another garment to make

211
00:16:05,312 --> 00:16:06,080
but agrees to make

212
00:16:07,616 --> 00:16:07,903

213
00:16:09,056 --> 00:16:12,736
day that's it for this week so hopefully next week I will have edited or the
