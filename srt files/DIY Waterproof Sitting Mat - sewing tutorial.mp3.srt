0
00:00:25,472 --> 00:00:31,520
so I created this the ward proof setting mass which is two days sewing tutorial it's

1
00:00:31,615 --> 00:00:33,248
got a simple strap ground-up

2
00:00:34,720 --> 00:00:39,903
which is held on with a proper or snap pastor that you could easily use a

3
00:00:39,967 --> 00:00:44,543
button or belt crow or some other fastness so that goes round up

4
00:00:45,791 --> 00:00:48,832
one wrap up its folded in a half with the

5
00:00:50,015 --> 00:00:51,360
waterproof side on the inside

6
00:00:52,416 --> 00:00:54,816
so as you can see I've just made a very simple

7
00:00:57,504 --> 00:01:02,335
curved corner square I think there's a better way to say that sicher square

8
00:01:05,087 --> 00:01:11,263
a square with curved curved corners square with curved corners so you are the strap on

9
00:01:11,328 --> 00:01:15,903
the side you've got a nice colorful top layer which is just made out of his

10
00:01:15,968 --> 00:01:21,632
dirty Carson and you've got a waterproof this is more of a canvas see fabric but

11
00:01:21,695 --> 00:01:26,783
it's still very flexible easy to roll up and then on the inside see minds a

12
00:01:26,816 --> 00:01:27,519
little bit crinkly

13
00:01:28,608 --> 00:01:35,839
and it's got a an insulated warding layer so I mean you could use non insulated

14
00:01:35,903 --> 00:01:39,711
warding on Jerold so do the job it just means that if it is a bit

15
00:01:39,839 --> 00:01:45,599
cold where you're going to fit it will hopefully make it a bit more mothy the

16
00:01:45,695 --> 00:01:50,847
idea came about during the pandemic so in the UK in particular they have a lot

17
00:01:50,879 --> 00:01:55,136
of rules about where you could meet people a lot of them revolved around you could

18
00:01:55,232 --> 00:02:00,863
meet more people outdoors or at one point you could only meet people outdoors for social

19
00:02:00,928 --> 00:02:05,279
situations just because the ventilations better and even when

20
00:02:06,431 --> 00:02:13,440
restrictions started easing off people still wanted to sit outside rather than indoors or a lot

21
00:02:13,535 --> 00:02:17,472
people did finally got around to making what was in my head and I thought I

22
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:17,983
share it

23
00:02:42,143 --> 00:02:46,688
first let's start with what you need so for this project you need half a meter

24
00:02:46,783 --> 00:02:49,311
of your main fabric which will be the top layer

25
00:02:50,399 --> 00:02:54,143
you need half a meter of insulated warding or any warning you have

26
00:02:55,423 --> 00:02:59,167
half a meter of water grief fabric for the base so I used a fairly thick

27
00:02:59,583 --> 00:03:05,503
canvas like fabric and but still had enough flexibility to fold away you also need at

28
00:03:05,567 --> 00:03:10,496
least thirty centimeters of some form of straps so for the one I've made I've used

29
00:03:10,527 --> 00:03:14,912
Hering bone twill tape as I had it to hand but webbing might be more robust

30
00:03:15,231 --> 00:03:18,912
if you have neither you could make a strap from left over fabric you will need

31
00:03:19,007 --> 00:03:19,904
something to

32
00:03:21,024 --> 00:03:27,136
secure your strap such as a snap fastener they'll grow a button or some other sort

33
00:03:27,167 --> 00:03:32,895
of closure you was they need matching thread a quoting foot and a temporary fabric spray

34
00:03:33,119 --> 00:03:38,272
are useful for this project but not as essential to make your template it's entirely up

35
00:03:38,335 --> 00:03:41,151
to you what shape you want to make but if you want to do the same

36
00:03:41,216 --> 00:03:45,983
as me I made a fool to to by forty to centimeter square to begin with

37
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:50,464
there is an I did this was because I decided to use one sense to me

38
00:03:50,527 --> 00:03:56,416
to seam allowance and I thought a forty by forty finished square would be sufficient once

39
00:03:56,511 --> 00:04:01,983
I have the square base I then used a small plate to soften the corners next

40
00:04:02,048 --> 00:04:07,839
you need to cut out your pieces so I cut out one of the template for

41
00:04:07,904 --> 00:04:13,503
the waterproof base then I cut out one top piece from the template

42
00:04:19,872 --> 00:04:24,223
once the top peace was cut out I attached it to my warding using the temporary

43
00:04:24,384 --> 00:04:30,656
Adisa spray however you could also use pens to keep it in place next I needed

44
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:36,063
to quote the top layer to the warding peace for this fabric I decided to use

45
00:04:36,191 --> 00:04:40,608
a crisscross pattern but it's entirely up to you how you want to quit your top

46
00:04:40,704 --> 00:04:48,191
layer to the wedding I decided to try to fairly evenly put I'm diamond shapes in

47
00:04:48,256 --> 00:04:53,152
between the dolphins again you might find a quoting fit handy for for this step but

48
00:04:53,279 --> 00:04:59,936
it is an essential especially because insulated boarding isn't that thick so hopefully it using a

49
00:05:00,032 --> 00:05:01,760
regular foot went to Stuart it too much

50
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:09,247
for the quoting I used one of those friction pens to mark out my lines just

51
00:05:09,279 --> 00:05:13,471
so that I had a guide when I stitched so these are very useful because they

52
00:05:14,015 --> 00:05:18,399
do disappear when you apply heat to it although I think there is a risk that

53
00:05:18,432 --> 00:05:23,359
they then can reappear if it gets too cold and but obviously you could use a

54
00:05:23,552 --> 00:05:28,704
proper fabric pen he could just use the pennant so if you wanted to it's entirely

55
00:05:28,799 --> 00:05:32,287
up to you just bear in mind that it might be worth testing it on a

56
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:37,279
section of the fabric before you commit to it so once I'd drawn out where I

57
00:05:37,407 --> 00:05:42,111
wanted my quoting lines to go I then moved to the sewing machine I added my

58
00:05:42,208 --> 00:05:48,160
quoting foot and I choose a fairly long stitch as I didn't need the stitches to

59
00:05:48,223 --> 00:05:53,824
be too close together I did all the lines in one direction and then I rotated

60
00:05:53,888 --> 00:05:59,295
it round and did the other lines that intersected once all the lines were stitched I

61
00:05:59,391 --> 00:06:04,127
then moved over to the ironing board and pressed it so that I could remove those

62
00:06:04,191 --> 00:06:08,671
lines that I made with the friction pen once the quoting was done I decided where

63
00:06:08,735 --> 00:06:10,239
I wanted to place the strap so

64
00:06:11,391 --> 00:06:16,895
for this one it was roughly eleven centimeters down from the top what you do is

65
00:06:16,992 --> 00:06:21,376
just line it up with the raw edge so I put up to the left of

66
00:06:21,567 --> 00:06:21,664
the

67
00:06:22,847 --> 00:06:27,455
front peace near the top and I would recommend just I'm taking it in place at

68
00:06:27,488 --> 00:06:32,608
this point I think I forgot to but you could attack it in place first before

69
00:06:33,343 --> 00:06:34,368
moving on to the next step

70
00:06:35,552 --> 00:06:40,864
so the next step is stitching the front and back pieces together for this you can

71
00:06:40,992 --> 00:06:46,559
use quoting clips or you could use pens to attach the bits together I guess I

72
00:06:46,944 --> 00:06:50,368
decided to use quoting clips because I have them to hand and I don't want to

73
00:06:50,432 --> 00:06:55,712
piss the waterproof fabric unnecessarily oversee if you are using pins you could just pin within

74
00:06:55,808 --> 00:07:00,223
that one centimeter seam allowance or whatever seam allowance you decided for yours

75
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:07,359
so once I'd pinned to the two pieces together all the way around I left a

76
00:07:07,519 --> 00:07:11,808
gap on one edge just so that I could turn it right side out I then

77
00:07:11,903 --> 00:07:16,832
moved over to the sewing machine and stitched the front and back together with the one

78
00:07:16,928 --> 00:07:18,111
centimeter seam allowance

79
00:07:27,071 --> 00:07:33,471
once that was done I then trimmed around the corners so I've used pink inches in

80
00:07:33,536 --> 00:07:39,615
this instance but you could just Antrim it with regular scissors just to help those corners

81
00:07:40,063 --> 00:07:42,496
or the curves come out on the right side

82
00:07:48,864 --> 00:07:52,671
then I flipped it around to the right side out and I used the wooden to

83
00:07:52,735 --> 00:07:55,167
adjust to help me on those corners in particular

84
00:08:15,264 --> 00:08:19,424
one stands right side out and then moved back over to the ironing board and pressed

85
00:08:19,519 --> 00:08:26,720
it to sharpen those corners now its right side out I then got a needle and

86
00:08:26,783 --> 00:08:29,312
thread and hand-stitched the opening closed

87
00:08:57,216 --> 00:09:03,583
then topstitched around the edge I did it one centimeters from the outside edge but you

88
00:09:03,711 --> 00:09:05,888
could bury this if you want to do

89
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:30,335
the final step was finishing off the raw edge of the strap and adding a fastener

90
00:09:30,591 --> 00:09:30,719
so

91
00:09:31,935 --> 00:09:37,695
in this instance I decided that I wanted my strap to be about twenty five centimeters

92
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:44,159
in length so I folded the raw-edged two centimeters in and then I folded it in

93
00:09:44,255 --> 00:09:50,143
again and that tucked in the raw edge I then stitched this on the sewing machine

94
00:09:50,719 --> 00:09:56,799
close to the inner folded edge to keep it in place you could also stitch the

95
00:09:57,247 --> 00:10:00,064
other folded edge as well just to make it extra secure

96
00:10:08,607 --> 00:10:14,815
then added the snap fastness so I added one end on that edge where I've got

97
00:10:14,976 --> 00:10:20,864
the folded over layer which is why I didn't bother adding the second line of stitching

98
00:10:21,151 --> 00:10:28,416
so I'd recommend just double checking by folding your sitting Matt and rolling it up just

99
00:10:28,447 --> 00:10:34,463
to check where you want the inside proper to lay further down the strap but in

100
00:10:34,528 --> 00:10:38,880
my instance I think it was a few centimeters from the actual Matt section

101
00:10:40,768 --> 00:10:46,015
so a final step which is entirely optional is I put some brain and stained protectors

102
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:53,088
prey on the nonword proof side obviously you could make the top layer award people water

103
00:10:53,151 --> 00:10:58,208
resistant fabric and this will help protect it for me I thought it would be nice

104
00:10:58,271 --> 00:11:02,815
to use this particular fabric which wasn't more to resistant or waterproof however I thought this

105
00:11:02,943 --> 00:11:08,031
might help it from getting too McKee when it's out and about so there you have

106
00:11:08,127 --> 00:11:12,992
it there's the waterproof setting that obviously you could do a lot of variations you could

107
00:11:13,247 --> 00:11:17,856
as a loop of elastic instead of a strap and then you could just flip it

108
00:11:17,888 --> 00:11:22,047
round and fasten it like that you could leave having a strap entirely if you don't

109
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:25,695
want to roll it up will you could make a little drawstring bag for it to

110
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:31,935
go in you could use a button a buckle Velcro is all sorts of ways you

111
00:11:32,031 --> 00:11:36,383
could vary this depending on what you've got and but I just thought be a good

112
00:11:37,023 --> 00:11:38,783
gift for yourself or for someone else

113
00:11:39,872 --> 00:11:40,607
thanks for watching
