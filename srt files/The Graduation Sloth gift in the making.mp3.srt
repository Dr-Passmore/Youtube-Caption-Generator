00:00:00,384 --> 00:00:04,544
hello today I'm going to show you how I made this graduation sloth so when I

1
00:00:04,639 --> 00:00:09,119
say made a graduation slope I just mean I made the attire I did not make

2
00:00:09,215 --> 00:00:11,552
the actual slope that was from Alster thank you

3
00:00:12,991 --> 00:00:17,760
so basically I'm gonna show you a time lapse of me creating it and give about

4
00:00:17,791 --> 00:00:21,408
or voice over to explain what I'm doing and when I'm going your long and then

5
00:00:21,503 --> 00:00:24,992
after it I'll do a bit of a conclusion just to explain what would is an

6
00:00:25,055 --> 00:00:30,879
differently next time anything that's not very clear on the time lapse so I made this

7
00:00:30,975 --> 00:00:35,967
for my part when he graduated just over a year ago he got his doctorate in

8
00:00:36,479 --> 00:00:36,928
philosophy

9
00:00:38,495 --> 00:00:44,416
and the reason I haven't and put it up on the channel yet is just because

10
00:00:44,479 --> 00:00:48,799
I hadn't got around to editing all of the footage and but I have now so

11
00:00:49,055 --> 00:00:49,312
enjoy

12
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:55,327
hello its clothing from proper creations and I've just quickly set up the camera it is

13
00:00:55,423 --> 00:00:57,152
my partner's finally left the flat

14
00:00:58,335 --> 00:01:04,255
basically my granters finish a cage de his graduating in two weeks so it's very exciting

15
00:01:04,447 --> 00:01:07,008
and but I do need to get his gift sorted out

16
00:01:08,127 --> 00:01:08,255
so

17
00:01:09,791 --> 00:01:14,751
basically he's starting a business and he's lacking from home is only there's really difficult for

18
00:01:14,816 --> 00:01:19,071
me to make anything without him like to think especially but what I want to record

19
00:01:19,136 --> 00:01:24,959
the progress as well so he'd finally gone out to see his business mentor which I

20
00:01:25,375 --> 00:01:30,111
jumped to the opportunity to just quickly work the camaron and do the short introduction so

21
00:01:30,624 --> 00:01:33,503
the plan is I'm going to make a graduation soft

22
00:01:35,167 --> 00:01:39,744
anyone who knows my partner and I see is quite chilled-out relax and his Perry animal

23
00:01:39,807 --> 00:01:44,543
probably is the slot so when it was father's day as I have these and sloth

24
00:01:45,248 --> 00:01:53,599
poison and which were any of either it doesn't mean that it's good chilled dad on

25
00:01:53,632 --> 00:01:54,015
the bottom

26
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:57,183
so I'm going to be I'm picking up

27
00:01:58,272 --> 00:02:02,655
and going to rage my cupboard stash I don't really want to buy any new fabric

28
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:07,648
for this project firstly because I won't leave that much to make this lost its graduation

29
00:02:07,711 --> 00:02:13,664
ropes but also where so inundated in the fabric because of all my boarding we don't

30
00:02:13,727 --> 00:02:17,376
need anyone so I'm gonna see my to be a bit creative with by options but

31
00:02:17,408 --> 00:02:21,248
I'm gonna try and replicate the once he's going to be wearing in two weeks

32
00:02:22,527 --> 00:02:28,895
but yeah basically make a replica set for this loss so that's my brief introduction and

33
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:32,479
I'm going to try and record the abyss as I go along without him noticing what

34
00:02:32,576 --> 00:02:36,832
I'm doing so if you might be in the background but hopefully he won't twig or

35
00:02:37,695 --> 00:02:41,279
won't ask any questions and what I'm doing or I can pass the others another project

36
00:02:42,848 --> 00:02:43,328
which we like

37
00:02:44,576 --> 00:02:50,399
okay so here I've got the graduation stuff some red fabric some black fabric

38
00:02:51,968 --> 00:02:58,335
some great red brick and some blue fabric so these are all the different colors that

39
00:02:58,880 --> 00:03:03,328
appear on the PhD graduation ropes for the university's graduating from

40
00:03:04,384 --> 00:03:11,712
so to begin with I started trying to unpick the chilled dad embroidery off the bottom

41
00:03:12,063 --> 00:03:20,447
of the sloth on its feet this proved to be completely impossible so at this stage

42
00:03:20,576 --> 00:03:27,455
I decided I needed to leave it for now but I did end up going back

43
00:03:27,712 --> 00:03:32,608
and fixing that which I'll explain later on right so to start with I decided to

44
00:03:32,703 --> 00:03:38,783
make the actual Gowon element as that would use the most fabric so here I am

45
00:03:38,848 --> 00:03:42,975
just I'm squaring off a bit I folded it over at the top the side places

46
00:03:43,072 --> 00:03:43,583
to the bottom

47
00:03:51,104 --> 00:03:56,960
right so I just am cut a hole roughly in the middle from the neck you

48
00:03:57,184 --> 00:04:02,207
see I'm just lining up and in the center front I've caught an opening

49
00:04:03,807 --> 00:04:07,776
which fits the sloth which is great so then I tried to neaten up but

50
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:10,240
neckline a little bit better

51
00:04:11,328 --> 00:04:14,688
after doing that I overlooked all the way around that front

52
00:04:15,936 --> 00:04:19,776
so the empty front sides and the neck opening

53
00:04:20,799 --> 00:04:25,631
and then after that I held it down just using a straight stitch on my machine

54
00:04:28,127 --> 00:04:32,447
so their own just I'm cutting some snipped into the neckline so that when I

55
00:04:33,855 --> 00:04:36,640
press it to make the him it was

56
00:04:37,664 --> 00:04:38,752
fold over easier

57
00:04:40,256 --> 00:04:43,648
there I am just sitting around that neckline with the sewing machine

58
00:04:46,048 --> 00:04:47,167
and cotton of the loose ends

59
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:58,944
doing it with this loss and here I'm picking the side wits' end so as she

60
00:04:59,007 --> 00:05:03,295
can see I needed to so down these sides seems

61
00:05:07,839 --> 00:05:10,783
now I've used a bit of Taylor's chalk to

62
00:05:12,063 --> 00:05:15,328
mark where I wanted to undo the stitching line

63
00:05:17,247 --> 00:05:23,231
and then I use some dress-making pins to hold it in place and then I repeated

64
00:05:23,295 --> 00:05:24,256
on the other side

65
00:05:31,839 --> 00:05:36,320
I checked the measurement I did on on the first side so that it would match

66
00:05:36,415 --> 00:05:38,208
up with the other side

67
00:06:19,648 --> 00:06:22,111
case the next day overlocked those side seams

68
00:06:47,776 --> 00:06:50,528
and then I put it back on the slope and for another hit

69
00:06:51,872 --> 00:06:57,152
so I folded it the other way round and so the scenes on the inside now

70
00:07:00,768 --> 00:07:05,055
I will say marked that him now because it was waiting long for the sloth and

71
00:07:05,119 --> 00:07:06,496
so just shortened it there

72
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:16,447
I did ever look on and the website to see how low and academic robes are

73
00:07:16,511 --> 00:07:21,055
meant to go and use that as a rough guide to the where to him Hemet

74
00:07:21,279 --> 00:07:21,791
on the slope

75
00:07:26,015 --> 00:07:29,791
see after I cut the him I overlooked the raw edge

76
00:07:36,768 --> 00:07:40,959
and then I set about and Heming it on the machine once more with a straight

77
00:07:41,055 --> 00:07:41,312
stitch

78
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:20,256
case at once all of that was set up I then put the ropes on once

79
00:08:20,351 --> 00:08:21,407
again for a fit

80
00:08:22,432 --> 00:08:23,552
and to check it still

81
00:08:25,183 --> 00:08:31,264
went round okay and as you can see it it looks fine at the stage

82
00:08:34,752 --> 00:08:38,559
a case in the next step was to work out how to do

83
00:08:40,831 --> 00:08:40,927
the

84
00:08:42,143 --> 00:08:43,455
hood that comes with

85
00:08:44,703 --> 00:08:45,119
the gown

86
00:08:46,943 --> 00:08:48,671
right so this is me trying to

87
00:08:50,495 --> 00:08:56,383
draw I think I'm looking at my phone at an example of what

88
00:08:57,664 --> 00:09:01,504
the hood looks like when it's not attached to the gown

89
00:09:03,135 --> 00:09:09,151
some roughly sketching this out to work out how to construct it

90
00:09:11,807 --> 00:09:12,831
now I'm just marking

91
00:09:14,015 --> 00:09:14,752
what colors

92
00:09:16,288 --> 00:09:21,919
which are colored fabrics I'm using so and saying the graves on the outside bit in

93
00:09:21,984 --> 00:09:25,567
this instance and then I'd need to line it with red so

94
00:09:26,783 --> 00:09:30,400
and yeah I'm just working out how big I want the pieces so

95
00:09:31,424 --> 00:09:36,992
okay so I roughly tried to work out the measurements for the hoods and as you

96
00:09:37,056 --> 00:09:42,400
can see I amended it but as I went along after that I drew it out

97
00:09:42,495 --> 00:09:47,039
on a bit of I had a bit of tracing paper to spare so I used

98
00:09:47,072 --> 00:09:47,328
that

99
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:11,487
then I cut this piece out

100
00:10:39,296 --> 00:10:41,343
right so I got out to pieces in the gray

101
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:47,679
and as you can see here I'm cutting out to pieces in the red fabric as

102
00:10:47,776 --> 00:10:51,200
well it was quite nice using this red fabric just because that's

103
00:10:52,992 --> 00:10:56,799
similar to the fabric that they actually used for the hood

104
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:05,375
actually to be fair even the gray was quite similar sort of I did you call

105
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:05,952
at nylon

106
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:13,280
anyway this was more of like a satiny and failed to say after that I then

107
00:11:13,599 --> 00:11:17,119
and moved over to the machine and started stitching

108
00:11:18,783 --> 00:11:21,823
first the to gray pieces together

109
00:11:28,671 --> 00:11:31,104
and then the to read pieces together

110
00:11:37,119 --> 00:11:41,440
that I did I'm I trained these pieces cause they were so small used pinking cheers

111
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:43,039
and to help

112
00:11:49,504 --> 00:11:55,935
and then I picked the gray and red pieces together so that I could sew them

113
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:56,479
in place

114
00:12:32,671 --> 00:12:36,927
a case the once I attached the gray and red vibrate pieces together

115
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:43,744
then use the pinking shears and as these would be enclosed scenes anyway and I wanted

116
00:12:43,776 --> 00:12:48,127
to reduce the bulk and then I turned it right side out so I left the

117
00:12:48,255 --> 00:12:49,343
gap in the scene

118
00:12:50,591 --> 00:12:51,872
said it could then

119
00:12:53,375 --> 00:12:54,591
be pulled the right way round

120
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,760
as you can see nice and sickly

121
00:13:21,056 --> 00:13:23,903
struggling to get at the right way round

122
00:13:26,432 --> 00:13:30,304
turned out to be a really narrow opening

123
00:13:46,815 --> 00:13:50,335
so in the end I got of the wife right way round and and then I

124
00:13:50,624 --> 00:13:53,791
slip stitch the opening toast

125
00:14:09,056 --> 00:14:13,440
I said to leave the other edge open just because it would not

126
00:14:14,815 --> 00:14:15,648
come out the right way

127
00:14:18,335 --> 00:14:20,703
unless had left the narrow opening

128
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:26,367
at the neck see I'm just joining together at the top

129
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:43,968
okay for them I tried it on to the sloth to check it would fit and

130
00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:45,408
there we had it

131
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:48,064
slots now but

132
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:54,559
the next part was to add a band of blue so this just go on the

133
00:14:54,719 --> 00:15:01,088
front edge so where the gown opens it it lays there and comes up

134
00:15:02,367 --> 00:15:03,616
I think behind the

135
00:15:04,992 --> 00:15:09,728
hut and then comes down the other side so for this I just wanted a straight

136
00:15:09,791 --> 00:15:10,815
rectangular tube

137
00:15:11,968 --> 00:15:17,184
and so that's what I'm doing here and cut out of peace and I'm just gonna

138
00:15:17,247 --> 00:15:25,088
simply make the same at the sides so also up one top shore and the long

139
00:15:25,184 --> 00:15:29,408
edge and then turn it around the other way and stitch the other side in place

140
00:15:35,583 --> 00:15:38,848
in hindsight I think I did make it slightly shorter

141
00:15:40,127 --> 00:15:46,047
and then it probably should have been and belly can see I prompted to leave it

142
00:15:46,143 --> 00:15:49,856
right to the last minute so I didn't go back and make anyone

143
00:16:06,015 --> 00:16:07,711
right so once I'd made that I

144
00:16:09,888 --> 00:16:11,200
tested it out on the slope

145
00:16:12,736 --> 00:16:14,400
also started spinning

146
00:16:16,192 --> 00:16:18,400
the gown that on to the slope

147
00:16:19,648 --> 00:16:20,960
because they don't want it to move

148
00:16:29,119 --> 00:16:32,064
can also see I'm just I correct in what the back of the hook looks like

149
00:16:40,064 --> 00:16:45,856
one side pinned all the pieces and place I started unstitching them down so that they

150
00:16:45,952 --> 00:16:46,591
wouldn't move

151
00:16:57,119 --> 00:17:03,872
and just doing some simple hand stitches they're trying to make them not to notice bull

152
00:17:04,255 --> 00:17:09,599
I'm just so that it won't move out place too much just catching it where it

153
00:17:09,663 --> 00:17:13,056
needs to not having any unnecessary stitching

154
00:17:39,296 --> 00:17:41,343
decency I'm changing color where necessary

155
00:17:42,368 --> 00:17:46,560
I will say using the bobbins that I've used in the same machine just because I

156
00:17:46,656 --> 00:17:46,719
know

157
00:17:48,192 --> 00:17:50,432
that I might as well use those up

158
00:17:52,735 --> 00:17:56,160
as I'm not sure that I'll need them in the same machine again necessarily so I

159
00:17:56,255 --> 00:17:59,264
might as well use the bit that I wound on to the bobbin rather than using

160
00:17:59,712 --> 00:18:00,576
the actual school

161
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:08,447
you see I'm being very precarious with the pins by just leaving them on the surface

162
00:18:08,671 --> 00:18:10,336
Oh no I've just tidied the month

163
00:18:12,031 --> 00:18:15,807
right so next I needed to look at making the

164
00:18:17,952 --> 00:18:21,984
main part of the hat so and you might be aware when you get your doctor

165
00:18:22,112 --> 00:18:24,319
it you get to where the floppy hat

166
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:30,816
which I think was one of his main ambitions on getting a PhD which sounds very

167
00:18:30,943 --> 00:18:37,823
cheeking so to make the circle I've used a circle cutter which I found in the

168
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:38,368
works

169
00:18:39,552 --> 00:18:44,255
for anyone who's based in the UK and I think it's about three pounds it's really

170
00:18:44,287 --> 00:18:48,832
useful you can either use the blade on the edge or you can use a pencil

171
00:18:48,895 --> 00:18:54,400
to market so I use the pencil because I'm not I'm not sure how sharp the

172
00:18:54,527 --> 00:18:59,776
leaders to be fair so anyway so I traced that one tracing paper and then cut

173
00:18:59,839 --> 00:19:00,255
it out

174
00:19:02,015 --> 00:19:06,047
so did that I did a gathering stitch so I just did a running stitch all

175
00:19:06,079 --> 00:19:10,047
the way around the circumference of that circle

176
00:19:11,232 --> 00:19:13,183
and then tested it on the slope

177
00:19:17,151 --> 00:19:21,952
okay someone today to so that was one day's adventures on it as you can see

178
00:19:22,079 --> 00:19:29,088
I'm wearing a different playsuit on this day although interestingly enough it's the exact same playsuit

179
00:19:29,215 --> 00:19:33,920
which is the so over at poppy playsuit which I seem to where all the time

180
00:19:34,176 --> 00:19:37,696
especially in videos right so I've just used the

181
00:19:39,167 --> 00:19:44,479
better fabric I've got for the the puffy part of the hat to create the brim

182
00:19:45,215 --> 00:19:48,991
I'm not really sure why I made a hole in the middle of this so as

183
00:19:49,056 --> 00:19:53,887
you can see I'm I'm costing two layers for the brim and just to give it

184
00:19:53,952 --> 00:19:55,583
a bit more integrity and structure

185
00:19:57,599 --> 00:20:01,472
and yeah for some reason I cut the whole out in the middle even though with

186
00:20:01,536 --> 00:20:05,631
hindsight I probably could have left it in because I was going to say the hat

187
00:20:05,696 --> 00:20:06,336
on anyway

188
00:20:09,119 --> 00:20:14,751
so yeah if you ever make this and perhaps leave the hole in the print because

189
00:20:14,848 --> 00:20:15,744
it's not the dust

190
00:20:17,631 --> 00:20:21,760
but obviously you know if you were trying to make one that you could detach I

191
00:20:21,887 --> 00:20:23,680
guess you can keep it

192
00:20:24,864 --> 00:20:28,895
with a to be fair I'm not sure how well it would stay on the slots

193
00:20:28,959 --> 00:20:29,439
head anyway

194
00:20:31,072 --> 00:20:31,680
right there any way

195
00:20:35,040 --> 00:20:39,296
of stitched it together and then I turned it right side out and then pressed it

196
00:20:39,359 --> 00:20:43,583
the right way and as you can see here I'm just stitching the

197
00:20:45,088 --> 00:20:51,008
close to the folded edge on the machine I've done two rows of stitching one at

198
00:20:51,167 --> 00:20:55,871
a slightly further and than the other and just again help with the

199
00:20:56,895 --> 00:21:02,463
structure of that room to be honest I probably could use some interfacing to make it

200
00:21:02,687 --> 00:21:03,423
and better

201
00:21:05,567 --> 00:21:10,463
there as it was a small hat I didn't feel like it was necessarily for this

202
00:21:10,527 --> 00:21:13,248
particular project so here I am struggling to

203
00:21:14,271 --> 00:21:20,000
to make a realistic looking hat even though I could have left the hole in the

204
00:21:20,063 --> 00:21:23,135
room so see I'm just stitching the

205
00:21:26,719 --> 00:21:28,095
top of the hat to the brim

206
00:21:29,312 --> 00:21:35,008
in this section and which was fairly fiddly that anyway so I managed to do that

207
00:21:36,576 --> 00:21:38,303
and then I tried it on

208
00:21:43,135 --> 00:21:48,095
once tried it on I put some pins and just to put it roughly in place

209
00:21:48,864 --> 00:21:51,328
and then I had to get on with making the tassel so

210
00:21:52,703 --> 00:21:55,615
you can see here I used the hangar to help me with this

211
00:21:58,624 --> 00:22:00,416
so you twist it round tight

212
00:22:02,015 --> 00:22:03,968
so that it makes a nice cord

213
00:22:05,439 --> 00:22:08,800
then once I had it at the required length I put a not in it and

214
00:22:09,855 --> 00:22:10,624
unwound the

215
00:22:12,031 --> 00:22:14,943
on that I was using so I've just used some some

216
00:22:16,287 --> 00:22:21,887
cheap my long on that I was already had a mustache and which looked roughly the

217
00:22:22,079 --> 00:22:22,656
bright color

218
00:22:23,936 --> 00:22:28,959
and then here so I then pinned it on the top and stitched it on and

219
00:22:29,248 --> 00:22:33,280
which actually turned out to be the wrong thing to do for this it turns out

220
00:22:33,536 --> 00:22:39,680
you're meant to have the tassel going round the room for the doctorate not going from

221
00:22:39,712 --> 00:22:45,343
the top which is more undergraduate masters level and but I probably explain that more at

222
00:22:45,407 --> 00:22:53,631
the end of the vitiate then I stitched it onto the slots heads

223
00:22:56,384 --> 00:23:00,703
which is why I didn't need to add a home in the hat

224
00:23:20,416 --> 00:23:25,823
and that's it pretty much done all ready to go for graduation

225
00:23:27,391 --> 00:23:31,359
okay so I hope you enjoyed the time lapse of me making the graduation sloth so

226
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:37,599
I'm here with my partner will not the graduation solution

227
00:23:39,615 --> 00:23:40,543
what did you people laugh

228
00:23:42,112 --> 00:23:48,063
yes well I actually saw my original introduction that I choose a slots because felt very

229
00:23:48,576 --> 00:23:54,784
it's very chilled-out and likes to take things slowly saying the slot seemed a very appropriate

230
00:23:54,848 --> 00:24:00,416
so when there was one in stir the father's day I thought that's brilliant I can

231
00:24:00,479 --> 00:24:02,144
adapt out for the graduation or

232
00:24:04,384 --> 00:24:10,495
very much to the yeah well you didn't get to keep the actual

233
00:24:11,615 --> 00:24:17,151
down and that not that you'd really where it not anywhere else but we can't all

234
00:24:17,215 --> 00:24:20,319
the time I can't get to your office driven up

235
00:24:21,728 --> 00:24:22,047
trench

236
00:24:23,712 --> 00:24:25,056
might get more like an outcast

237
00:24:27,104 --> 00:24:29,472
so were the things I do differently next time

238
00:24:30,656 --> 00:24:34,784
and the main thing that's really bothering me is that I've done the castle room

239
00:24:37,407 --> 00:24:41,984
it really annoys me but it obviously doesn't annoy me enough to actually go back and

240
00:24:42,784 --> 00:24:44,160
amende it so

241
00:24:49,439 --> 00:24:50,816
it is because

242
00:24:51,871 --> 00:24:58,784
it's fine for a bore an Emmy like so an undergraduate or a master's because on

243
00:24:58,848 --> 00:25:02,816
a mortarboard it comes from the center that one the floppy hat you had to feel

244
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:08,479
PhD yeah it's meant to go around this part way around and then it ties up

245
00:25:08,703 --> 00:25:12,864
and then the tussle comes out from there she will come from the top middle I

246
00:25:12,927 --> 00:25:13,567
see what you mean

247
00:25:14,592 --> 00:25:15,135
I don't mind

248
00:25:17,472 --> 00:25:21,119
every time I look at it though I do think it's wrong so maybe one day

249
00:25:21,248 --> 00:25:21,504
I will

250
00:25:23,583 --> 00:25:27,936
I will adjust to the saying that I've got quite a lot of them close that

251
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,303
I need to fix unaffectionate

252
00:25:31,552 --> 00:25:34,784
separately I go around to her just look at every time go wrong

253
00:25:35,807 --> 00:25:42,015
and another thing that might not be clear in the video I think resolute discover later

254
00:25:42,303 --> 00:25:46,463
is that I could not get the machine embroidered

255
00:25:47,712 --> 00:25:54,816
chilled-out of the feet so I had to think of another solution and this was casting

256
00:25:54,911 --> 00:26:01,439
out some felt souls for the sloth so what I've done is I've used blanket stitch

257
00:26:01,567 --> 00:26:08,767
to attach the felt on to and the feet and then I've used chainstitch to embroider

258
00:26:09,984 --> 00:26:11,040
my father's title

259
00:26:12,767 --> 00:26:16,319
on one foot and then I put the date that he graduated on the other foot

260
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:23,072
man who has been a hatchet only just been a month to month a year

261
00:26:34,368 --> 00:26:34,911
if you say so

262
00:26:36,608 --> 00:26:43,072
yeah I think that's pretty much effect

263
00:26:46,463 --> 00:26:50,112
it was quite did actually on the day because you could tell people were looking at

264
00:26:50,176 --> 00:26:52,416
the sloth and wondering why he could buy it

265
00:26:53,567 --> 00:26:53,887
Mr

266
00:26:55,008 --> 00:27:01,312
they had those like traditional bears that the multiple its progress they don't stop because most

267
00:27:01,407 --> 00:27:02,208
people don't make

268
00:27:03,232 --> 00:27:08,063
and don't go the way to a PhD and the crazy people what it was from

269
00:27:08,128 --> 00:27:12,800
the four years who lived in one joint project for a title yeah so you can't

270
00:27:12,864 --> 00:27:19,104
get many like souvenir beds which have the air floppy hat version so at least I'm

271
00:27:19,552 --> 00:27:23,647
you know this was more accurate for the title he was caught racing with

272
00:27:26,112 --> 00:27:26,271
much

273
00:27:30,144 --> 00:27:34,400
else good point then only quite general aren't they just you know have the black robes

274
00:27:34,463 --> 00:27:38,975
and the worst board and fear it's just a bit more of a personal touch so

275
00:27:39,552 --> 00:27:42,400
yeah it's a good way to use up some scraps as well I didn't have to

276
00:27:42,463 --> 00:27:48,895
buy anything extra for even the thought I had to hand and they yeah yeah you

277
00:27:48,991 --> 00:27:51,104
can you got a musket

278
00:27:54,495 --> 00:27:54,943
until

279
00:27:56,959 --> 00:27:57,599
you're very chair

280
00:27:59,264 --> 00:28:03,167
I get all that it for this time I hope you enjoyed there and we'll see

281
00:28:03,264 --> 00:28:03,615
you soon
