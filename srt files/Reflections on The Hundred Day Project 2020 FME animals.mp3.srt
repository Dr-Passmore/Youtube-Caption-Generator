00:00:00,671 --> 00:00:05,823
today I'm going to discuss my hundred-day project have a better reflect on how the hundred

1
00:00:05,855 --> 00:00:10,303
days went possibly what I do differently next time and which ones were my favorites as

2
00:00:10,368 --> 00:00:13,503
always if you like this video would like sea-wall please don't forget to like unsubscribe if

3
00:00:13,567 --> 00:00:17,247
you haven't already I think it's quite important when you've done a project like this to

4
00:00:17,312 --> 00:00:21,600
reflect on how it went to see what works what didn't what you might do to

5
00:00:21,631 --> 00:00:24,895
for the next time and whether you would do us again for what went well I

6
00:00:25,055 --> 00:00:29,856
think planning of preparation went fairly well I did well in the sense that I picked

7
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:34,464
my hundred animals before the project started so I had to think I drew up a

8
00:00:34,527 --> 00:00:38,911
list and I wrote down on a sat for a piece of paper each animal that

9
00:00:38,944 --> 00:00:43,487
I decided on wanted to pick a decent range so I didn't end up having my

10
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,527
all bird so I don't know a particular

11
00:00:47,551 --> 00:00:52,063
type of animal the advantage of then putting on a piece of paper and putting them

12
00:00:52,127 --> 00:00:56,032
in a box so that I then didn't know the order of these animals was also

13
00:00:56,159 --> 00:01:00,672
important though because it added a bit of spontaneity to the project so although it was

14
00:01:00,736 --> 00:01:05,120
nice knowing that I had a hundred animals by groups to complete projects I didn't have

15
00:01:05,183 --> 00:01:08,543
to go each day Oh gosh which and am I going to do which one of

16
00:01:08,608 --> 00:01:13,248
I already done I found it very useful to have that element of surprise as well

17
00:01:13,344 --> 00:01:17,984
because it didn't make me curious the next day to go or I wonder which animal

18
00:01:18,047 --> 00:01:22,143
I'm going to be searching today so that definitely help and I would recommend adding the

19
00:01:22,272 --> 00:01:26,655
element this price of you can something I didn't do quite as well as was planning

20
00:01:26,751 --> 00:01:31,648
the supplies but had no idea what type of colors I was going to get through

21
00:01:32,127 --> 00:01:36,991
which in hindsight was a bit line because it was quite obvious that of the animals

22
00:01:37,087 --> 00:01:43,232
were graze Brown's so really I should have preplanned the things colors I also almost ran

23
00:01:43,295 --> 00:01:47,615
out of fabric it turned how I did actually have some more white caligo and research

24
00:01:47,711 --> 00:01:52,447
that was the right wait I did end up ordering a couple of I'm different fabrics

25
00:01:52,543 --> 00:01:56,416
online and I couldn't quite get the same type so it was really lucky I did

26
00:01:56,480 --> 00:02:01,055
find smore my stash I'm but it would have helped if I just grated on my

27
00:02:01,152 --> 00:02:05,664
stash from the start cast out all hundred squares I think the reason I didn't cut

28
00:02:05,695 --> 00:02:09,919
out all the hundred twins was because I was worried that I might not finished project

29
00:02:09,983 --> 00:02:14,688
so I don't want to cut how a hundred put that expectation for myself and the

30
00:02:14,751 --> 00:02:18,399
pressure to succeed and then find out that a cart you know

31
00:02:19,839 --> 00:02:23,488
seventy-odd squares that I never ended up using all the project to be very probably what

32
00:02:23,552 --> 00:02:27,391
it used them to make cuts wouldn't have been a complete right off but anyway I

33
00:02:27,455 --> 00:02:32,863
can affect that head and of calico even if it wasn't cut out obviously locked down

34
00:02:33,055 --> 00:02:38,143
and the pandemic did make it a bit more challenging to replenish these supplies so I

35
00:02:38,207 --> 00:02:41,824
was quite lucky because of the craft had to say or they keep having sold so

36
00:02:42,367 --> 00:02:45,759
I did manage to replenish some of the columns but it was quite hard to select

37
00:02:45,824 --> 00:02:50,527
them because sometimes they don't always look quite the same in person as they do own

38
00:02:50,623 --> 00:02:55,391
mind so we did find side selected the future of the brown but actually I had

39
00:02:55,455 --> 00:03:00,160
a huge gap still in my color palettes so to speak and which I probably wouldn't

40
00:03:00,192 --> 00:03:04,608
have missed I want if I'd gone into a store likewise with the fabric I could

41
00:03:04,639 --> 00:03:09,759
have just popped down into a local shop and chosen a meeting white beach calico but

42
00:03:09,824 --> 00:03:10,367
I was really

43
00:03:11,391 --> 00:03:16,000
I had no idea on the fabric Piper gone on what weights that was so even

44
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:22,527
the GSM that they shed on Patrick's online had no idea what wait the one I

45
00:03:22,623 --> 00:03:25,216
had was perhaps I should have looked this up to see if I could have worked

46
00:03:25,343 --> 00:03:30,464
out myself but I didn't do that they think I have learnt from this challenge I

47
00:03:30,783 --> 00:03:34,944
have learned that if you shall walk every day and do something for his estimate of

48
00:03:34,975 --> 00:03:38,559
time that you would have any get results I was slow it the start however I

49
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:43,360
was using lower quality threat and in the end I started using it less and less

50
00:03:43,583 --> 00:03:48,960
and pretty crutch the latter ones aren't using the lower quality throughout it all I did

51
00:03:49,119 --> 00:03:52,544
the odd time just because I didn't have the right color in the high quality shapes

52
00:03:53,343 --> 00:03:56,735
but I tried to avoid it because I mean if if you've seen any of the

53
00:03:56,800 --> 00:04:02,559
time lapses I just kept having to rethread it it would break it would you know

54
00:04:02,688 --> 00:04:07,360
get tangled up and then I'd spent a lot of time rectifying that so and that's

55
00:04:07,391 --> 00:04:12,768
something else that I don't use it levelly start up with better quality resources another point

56
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:16,608
of reflection is that some days are harder than others I did get into a routine

57
00:04:16,704 --> 00:04:21,471
I found that the morning was best for me some days I just wasn't in the

58
00:04:21,536 --> 00:04:25,055
mean to do in the morning in which he could be quickly scrambling around doing it

59
00:04:25,088 --> 00:04:29,567
before beds which is fine you just have days like that and I had to learn

60
00:04:29,631 --> 00:04:34,783
to accept that I found this a really useful exercise in learning to paste myself having

61
00:04:34,847 --> 00:04:39,104
a chronic illness I really do need to learn that lesson I know that I can't

62
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:45,343
just spend a couple of days solid sewing a lot of the time because it just

63
00:04:45,984 --> 00:04:49,696
exhausts me pretty much for the rest to the week having to fix myself and not

64
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:53,664
knowing which animals on the next day so I couldn't plan for it I found that

65
00:04:53,888 --> 00:04:57,183
quite challenging at the start but I did get into a rhythm and I did have

66
00:04:57,247 --> 00:05:01,183
to face that and accept it so in a way it worked really well that had

67
00:05:01,247 --> 00:05:04,928
unresearched one of the animals and what's that template straight away it would be a lot

68
00:05:04,992 --> 00:05:08,608
quicker if I Donald out but to be honest I didn't have time before the challenge

69
00:05:08,928 --> 00:05:11,808
at the start of the project I found that I was a lot more hesitant I

70
00:05:11,872 --> 00:05:18,048
was really worried about choosing wrong color not stitching the outline correctly I found that these

71
00:05:18,111 --> 00:05:23,391
worries dissipated by the further down the line so probably the first two weeks were the

72
00:05:23,519 --> 00:05:26,911
only couple of weeks where I was really like or grush is the story color for

73
00:05:26,976 --> 00:05:30,911
this animal I'm not sure ocean I've added that shading by the time I got to

74
00:05:30,944 --> 00:05:34,687
be and it is like yeah okay let's do that that really helped and it to

75
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:39,872
show that exposure to it there helps you overcome it boundary day product also showed me

76
00:05:40,096 --> 00:05:45,279
that it is essentially a habit it's a great way to build a habit if you

77
00:05:45,567 --> 00:05:50,528
do end up doing hundred-day project but to be honest I think this particular project wasn't

78
00:05:50,752 --> 00:05:56,320
that sustainable for a long time habit I have taken a nice few days' rest since

79
00:05:56,447 --> 00:06:03,488
finishing the hundred animal and I'm quite enjoying having that bit of respite however I really

80
00:06:03,552 --> 00:06:08,191
do appreciate that it did make me set up my sewing machine every day which is

81
00:06:08,256 --> 00:06:11,808
something I don't want me to do I do have periods of time when I don't

82
00:06:11,839 --> 00:06:16,000
use my so machine at all sometimes are going months without doing three machine embroidery so

83
00:06:16,256 --> 00:06:20,063
it was really nice to get back on board with that and get some results moving

84
00:06:20,127 --> 00:06:25,023
forward I'm not really sure what goes to to squares I'm thinking either equipped for a

85
00:06:25,119 --> 00:06:31,071
wall hanging probably a wall-hanging but I keep coming and iring about it I was considering

86
00:06:31,167 --> 00:06:35,200
making individual cups or framing them but I mean framing them would take up a lot

87
00:06:35,231 --> 00:06:39,424
more room than a wall hanging and would be a lot more expensive and for cards

88
00:06:39,648 --> 00:06:43,071
I think some of the animals might not work as well for that and it also

89
00:06:43,167 --> 00:06:47,936
seems a shame in a way to split up the set moving on to my favorite

90
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,552
one's got spinous I think my favorite one and I think it was from day to

91
00:06:51,776 --> 00:06:55,231
is the evening I'm not sure what it is about it but I really like that

92
00:06:55,264 --> 00:06:59,264
one the great second is the sea Tasso which was quite challenging one to make it

93
00:06:59,776 --> 00:07:05,023
looks like from the college which will see shortly it was the longest make as am

94
00:07:05,152 --> 00:07:09,951
I really enjoyed that one and I quite like the peacock as well actually so on

95
00:07:09,984 --> 00:07:14,144
of names three for the favorite but I think the human was definitely my whole round

96
00:07:14,239 --> 00:07:19,200
favorite out of the whole project which yet ironically was dating you can say that's a

97
00:07:19,455 --> 00:07:22,687
wrap up from me but what I will do is leave you with the college of

98
00:07:22,944 --> 00:07:26,976
all of the videos running at the same time so my partner was getting to a

99
00:07:27,007 --> 00:07:32,480
bit of video-editing so he has kindly edited this for me and it just shows which

100
00:07:32,575 --> 00:07:37,055
ones take the longest as well which is quite interesting thanks to everyone who has come

101
00:07:37,088 --> 00:07:38,880
along for the right and thanks for watching
