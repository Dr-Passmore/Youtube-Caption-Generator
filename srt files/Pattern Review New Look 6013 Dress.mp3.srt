hello today I'm reviewing this dress as the ways that you like this video I would

1
00:00:05,087 --> 00:00:08,352
like to see more please don't forget to like unsubscribe if you haven't already like this

2
00:00:08,447 --> 00:00:13,152
dress is the new look sick zero one tree which I fortunately had two copies of

3
00:00:13,215 --> 00:00:19,840
so I cut direct from the pattern pieces for a change normally I traced my passions

4
00:00:20,191 --> 00:00:24,159
just in case I want to make a different sides for someone else or it goes

5
00:00:24,191 --> 00:00:27,455
horribly wrong and I need to cut it in a different side I despised it's very

6
00:00:27,488 --> 00:00:28,159
handy to

7
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:33,183
safeguard our passions that way but to see it does take a lot more time to

8
00:00:33,279 --> 00:00:37,728
do that so it really was and how much time before so this address is a

9
00:00:37,791 --> 00:00:42,111
view would do on the pattern which is the dress I'm so in this pattern you

10
00:00:42,175 --> 00:00:44,352
can also make a jacket or blazer

11
00:00:45,375 --> 00:00:48,479
and there are different variations on that actually you can with make a sort of waste

12
00:00:48,543 --> 00:00:53,951
kept and there are some trousers as well which you can create so for this person

13
00:00:54,368 --> 00:00:59,136
I made the size courtin the fabric of uses from pound fabrics I bought it a

14
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:03,456
couple of years ago so I'm not completely sure on the content I'm not sure he

15
00:01:03,487 --> 00:01:09,919
would actually advertise that but I'm pretty sure at the polyester and it's quite lightweight and

16
00:01:10,047 --> 00:01:15,872
drapey so it's really nice for addressed but I wasn't too sure because of how lightweight

17
00:01:15,935 --> 00:01:18,431
it was and also the how

18
00:01:19,552 --> 00:01:25,536
how we pick it was so why did do was I got some ivory antistatic lining

19
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:30,816
from a much more local shock to me truly fabrics and so I have minded with

20
00:01:30,944 --> 00:01:36,896
that which should hope please stop it from catching or rising up prophecy there is a

21
00:01:36,959 --> 00:01:42,559
risk with polyester that it will become quite static the to cleave that additional layer will

22
00:01:42,912 --> 00:01:47,391
support it and as they make sure that you know it's definitely okay thick this fabric

23
00:01:47,487 --> 00:01:51,583
was early challenging to work with I did have to be quite careful I think the

24
00:01:52,288 --> 00:01:52,736
first

25
00:01:53,791 --> 00:01:57,791
bits of stitching such as the thoughts I did taxes but then I go a bit

26
00:01:57,823 --> 00:02:01,279
more reckless near the end and you really get in times of difficulty I think this

27
00:02:01,344 --> 00:02:05,407
is quite a beginner friendly project you can obviously make it more challenging I think adding

28
00:02:05,472 --> 00:02:11,072
aligning like I did definitely leveled it up significantly if you use a much more stable

29
00:02:11,167 --> 00:02:16,608
fabric than I did that would make it easier I think the fabric choice and the

30
00:02:16,639 --> 00:02:21,664
fact that I traced a line it made it a much more challenging make for me

31
00:02:21,792 --> 00:02:26,175
personally and it has taken me quite a word to complete it but saying that I

32
00:02:26,272 --> 00:02:31,296
think that the fact that is got Ragland sleeves it's probably quite good for a beginner

33
00:02:31,615 --> 00:02:35,776
it's a lot easier to fit regular sleeves than it is to fit in set and

34
00:02:35,839 --> 00:02:40,095
sleeves you don't have to worry about easing into the shoulder moving on to the design

35
00:02:40,192 --> 00:02:46,175
and it's the reason I chose this person is because I really do like regular sleeps

36
00:02:46,272 --> 00:02:50,848
I think it's quite a nice classic style so it's but I start to but it's

37
00:02:50,975 --> 00:02:56,128
also got and does but low as well on the waist and it's got that at

38
00:02:56,192 --> 00:03:01,119
the fact so it shapes nicely but it's quite and it's quite I'm the least fell

39
00:03:01,248 --> 00:03:06,048
me anyway I'm it's got a reasonable amount of ease obviously you could adjust that if

40
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:10,464
you'd prefer a more fitted garments so I didn't adjust the length of this

41
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:16,479
dress however I think I probably didn't leave a bit of length when I'm I got

42
00:03:16,511 --> 00:03:21,664
my Fondor to help me level up to him before I hand it I said it's

43
00:03:21,792 --> 00:03:26,304
pretty much dead on I'm knee level for me which I quite like I don't like

44
00:03:26,399 --> 00:03:30,975
wearing really short dresses so this is a suitable length for me to just a job

45
00:03:31,039 --> 00:03:36,479
it and this topstitching is optional so you don't need to add that I did add

46
00:03:36,544 --> 00:03:41,535
it mainly because I forgot to unstitch the under stitching and I was worried about the

47
00:03:42,048 --> 00:03:47,007
facing peeping out so I thought the best thing to do would be and to have

48
00:03:47,039 --> 00:03:50,880
that topstitching which are things about maybe two centimeters away from the edge

49
00:03:52,031 --> 00:03:54,783
it does had a very nice detail what I don't think this is a really this

50
00:03:54,880 --> 00:03:59,839
fabric needed it so the way I lined it I have actually lined everything so I'd

51
00:03:59,904 --> 00:04:04,863
like the sleeves as well I did get really confused and the reason I probably left

52
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:09,600
it but about a month or so it's because I couldn't work out how to

53
00:04:11,552 --> 00:04:12,320
line the sleeves

54
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:18,272
and him the CD part and attach it all together now I look back I can't

55
00:04:18,335 --> 00:04:21,055
actually room but how I did this even though I only did this a week ago

56
00:04:21,536 --> 00:04:22,496
this part of the pattern

57
00:04:23,903 --> 00:04:27,007
but yet so I got stored on this section and

58
00:04:28,223 --> 00:04:32,160
after leaving it for quite a number of weeks I then went back to it and

59
00:04:32,191 --> 00:04:35,903
then managed to do what I was trying to avoid and which was twisted so that

60
00:04:35,936 --> 00:04:39,104
you couldn't learn tell it right side out so I end up doing that I had

61
00:04:39,135 --> 00:04:42,368
to unpick it anyway and then I worked out how to

62
00:04:43,584 --> 00:04:46,911
line it properly so I have actually I wonder stitch the

63
00:04:48,191 --> 00:04:50,303
the sleep him so I did stitch

64
00:04:51,519 --> 00:04:53,023
the sleeve pieces together at the him

65
00:04:54,399 --> 00:04:57,343
at the point in the instructions other boys to hammer

66
00:04:58,592 --> 00:05:01,088
but then I did manage to still stitch

67
00:05:02,368 --> 00:05:07,424
the sleeves onto the main piece of the lining and the main favorite pieces and to

68
00:05:07,488 --> 00:05:12,223
the main fabric sleep he says if that makes sense is any I found lining the

69
00:05:12,287 --> 00:05:16,127
dress very confusing and I like done it because I think I'm gonna wear a lot

70
00:05:16,191 --> 00:05:21,920
more because I would get frustrated with it I'm going in staticky but it was very

71
00:05:21,984 --> 00:05:26,208
confusing and I did find that that holds me up quite a long in the process

72
00:05:26,911 --> 00:05:32,096
which brings me I'm quite nicely to time taken so I started this in February and

73
00:05:32,608 --> 00:05:38,048
initiatives and day so that's about mid-June so it's taken me quite a long time to

74
00:05:38,079 --> 00:05:42,335
get it done obviously I did get stalled and I was in future I was doing

75
00:05:42,368 --> 00:05:46,175
at one point so that helped me up quite a lot I think if you made

76
00:05:46,272 --> 00:05:50,528
it in a much more stable fabric and you didn't have to line it you could

77
00:05:50,656 --> 00:05:54,335
definitely don't in a weekend I do some people are superquick so is like for me

78
00:05:54,399 --> 00:05:59,679
down in the day but I think using a much more interesting fabric like this where

79
00:05:59,776 --> 00:06:04,032
it does move around quite a lot and if you're not used to lining dresses and

80
00:06:04,096 --> 00:06:07,712
you want to Billy line it like I have it could take you a bit longer

81
00:06:07,903 --> 00:06:11,648
saying that it probably wouldn't take me as long as it has this time now that

82
00:06:11,712 --> 00:06:15,839
I've modeled my boy through once even though I can't quite ruler that how I managed

83
00:06:15,903 --> 00:06:16,063
to

84
00:06:17,183 --> 00:06:20,704
finish off the lining I'm sure I could do a lot like the next time another

85
00:06:20,799 --> 00:06:27,104
thing that I did which I wish I hadn't was that my machine stitched the lining

86
00:06:27,231 --> 00:06:31,743
and facing while attaching the zip to the main bit of the fabric so in the

87
00:06:31,808 --> 00:06:35,359
pattern using ordinaries it and it meant to the last sip at the back and we

88
00:06:35,424 --> 00:06:38,208
don't know who to but I put had invisible second

89
00:06:39,679 --> 00:06:45,152
so the invisible sip I felt was a lot easier to insert and elapses because I

90
00:06:45,247 --> 00:06:49,855
was that really confused on the instructions they have a fairly decent trunk of instructions for

91
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:54,015
the zip that is only a couple of diagrams and I was getting really confused so

92
00:06:54,303 --> 00:06:56,223
in the end I thought I'm gonna cut my losses

93
00:06:57,376 --> 00:07:00,704
I can't be dealing with this and I think I could have done it if I

94
00:07:01,088 --> 00:07:04,384
hadn't added a lining but because I needed to add the lining bear and I really

95
00:07:04,447 --> 00:07:09,696
couldn't work out how to incorporate that with the lobster I thought it's gonna be easier

96
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:13,247
to add an invisible did so what do you wish I had done differently I don't

97
00:07:13,279 --> 00:07:18,048
regret the invisible did I think it suits this dress quite well anyway more than potentially

98
00:07:18,272 --> 00:07:22,368
a lapse it would have it's particularly with this fabric I think it might the fabric

99
00:07:22,399 --> 00:07:26,880
Mike direct quite a lot when I stitched in place but I do wish I'd hand-stitched

100
00:07:27,007 --> 00:07:31,104
the lining and the facing because at the top where I've got the

101
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:37,920
facing stitched in on the zip it's just a bit too close to the teeth so

102
00:07:38,656 --> 00:07:42,720
he does go up fine but it is a bit of a challenge to throw it

103
00:07:42,783 --> 00:07:47,071
up it always kind of stop sundews woke and you have to carefully then not it

104
00:07:47,104 --> 00:07:50,656
along to sit right up to the top I mean at least it still works and

105
00:07:50,687 --> 00:07:53,855
I didn't have to one pick it but in a way I probably should have one

106
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:57,631
pictor and then again just because it would be so much easy to sit up and

107
00:07:57,664 --> 00:08:02,111
down so overrule I do recommend this person I really like it I think it's a

108
00:08:02,175 --> 00:08:08,256
nice her class address the necklines quite less as well I think that early flattering I

109
00:08:08,351 --> 00:08:12,447
think I would potentially make this again I'm not to make it any time singing and

110
00:08:12,511 --> 00:08:16,959
I'd be quite interested to try with a slightly easier fabric maybe of the linen blend

111
00:08:17,183 --> 00:08:21,119
might be quite nice here for now I'm looking forward to wearing this out of it

112
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:25,760
and seeing how much I like it but I think next time I make it I

113
00:08:25,855 --> 00:08:31,648
may double check the fist at the front I'm not sure and the dots are in

114
00:08:31,679 --> 00:08:34,719
the right place or I might need to take it in slightly I think at the

115
00:08:34,848 --> 00:08:39,263
middle which oracy by the time I realized it was too late to do on this

116
00:08:39,359 --> 00:08:41,312
one and silver see something I'd have to

117
00:08:42,495 --> 00:08:47,263
adjust at the cutting stage but also I think possibly with a different fabric it wouldn't

118
00:08:47,296 --> 00:08:52,671
be an issue I think it might just be consiste fabrics so drapey that might have

119
00:08:52,703 --> 00:08:55,935
been an issue with it all I'm happy with it and I think I will get

120
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:59,296
some good you sense of its that's it for this time thanks for watching
