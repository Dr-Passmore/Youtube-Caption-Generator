00:00:00,096 --> 00:00:03,328
hello today I'm going to be making some gift tax if you like this video and

1
00:00:03,359 --> 00:00:06,303
would like to see more police so thing at the life and subscribe okay so with

2
00:00:06,368 --> 00:00:11,135
Christmas last little week away I thought I'd make some fabric gift tax I don't only

3
00:00:11,232 --> 00:00:15,071
do this and I'm not sure how awful with the end result I just thought I'd

4
00:00:15,104 --> 00:00:19,200
give it a go I'm going to make some for my partner's gift because I think

5
00:00:19,295 --> 00:00:23,968
everyone else has got their gifts now because I won't be seeing him and between now

6
00:00:24,063 --> 00:00:28,319
and Christmas as well so close to it because I see well every year it's very

7
00:00:28,447 --> 00:00:32,608
easy for me to scoop up the gift like in him so it does mean that

8
00:00:33,248 --> 00:00:36,063
it's something I can reuse year on year I can make a few of them so

9
00:00:36,159 --> 00:00:40,127
depending how many gifts like a fill each year you know I could make safe five

10
00:00:40,223 --> 00:00:43,104
of them and then if I didn't ease one of just packet away with the Christmas

11
00:00:43,136 --> 00:00:50,880
decorations and yeah basically I can just store the effects with the I'm Christmas decorations and

12
00:00:50,911 --> 00:00:55,583
then when it comes out next year I can then reuse them again but yes this

13
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:59,071
will be the trial run should we say and then I might roll it out to

14
00:01:00,127 --> 00:01:04,416
other people I actually make up yet swore and protect me in my family so what

15
00:01:04,480 --> 00:01:10,304
I've begun with is I've got a simple table which I made on our document so

16
00:01:10,912 --> 00:01:18,143
with the word document on portrait alignment I created a to by five table and made

17
00:01:18,208 --> 00:01:19,648
it as long as the

18
00:01:20,863 --> 00:01:21,152
sheet

19
00:01:22,208 --> 00:01:23,648
obviously had told the the order as well

20
00:01:24,959 --> 00:01:29,823
and the I said is that I'm going to draw some potential Christmas designs on here

21
00:01:30,111 --> 00:01:34,080
what I'd like to do in the end is I'm going to have two layers of

22
00:01:34,143 --> 00:01:38,239
fabrics I'm gonna have a piece fabric was gonna have a design on and the other

23
00:01:38,335 --> 00:01:44,608
side his games have the message now it's not for everyone but I really like writing

24
00:01:44,832 --> 00:01:48,736
with three machine and orangery I don't know why this is probably because I studied English

25
00:01:48,959 --> 00:01:50,431
I really like handwriting and

26
00:01:51,456 --> 00:01:56,447
is an arrow just quite enjoyed doing it free hand obviously if you have an embroidery

27
00:01:56,543 --> 00:02:01,888
sewing machine which has Lesters brilliant you could write your iMessage even easier with that so

28
00:02:01,919 --> 00:02:05,568
you could create your tag a lot simpler but I'm gonna do a free hand and

29
00:02:05,664 --> 00:02:08,255
if you don't have an a greater in the machine and you don't want to do

30
00:02:08,511 --> 00:02:12,639
machine stitching you could just wrote it with the fabric pen that would be absolutely fine

31
00:02:12,703 --> 00:02:12,960
as well

32
00:02:14,175 --> 00:02:18,432
rights I'm gonna get one and create some designs in case my first crops get is

33
00:02:18,559 --> 00:02:23,520
a slightly wanky looking Christmas tree very basic I've just done a cone shape for I

34
00:02:23,583 --> 00:02:28,479
guess the triangle seven kind and I did a little star on the top and then

35
00:02:29,695 --> 00:02:32,735
a couple of lines to the trunk and then puts at the bottom I've left a

36
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:35,455
little bit of a gap of the top because I do want to add a little

37
00:02:35,968 --> 00:02:39,871
home to that I can that be that string with wine through so that I can

38
00:02:39,936 --> 00:02:43,520
attach it to the and gift in question you also want to leave a little bit

39
00:02:43,552 --> 00:02:46,399
of a border just because you'll need to stitch the front and back sections with the

40
00:02:46,464 --> 00:02:49,600
tag together I think when I do this I've done this slightly over to the left

41
00:02:49,695 --> 00:02:51,423
so for we will shift it slightly

42
00:03:20,447 --> 00:03:22,496
my reindeer find looks like a pig with amahs

43
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:27,904
the cockpit grain that

44
00:03:30,527 --> 00:03:31,231
I don't want that

45
00:04:05,408 --> 00:04:05,503
it's

46
00:04:08,576 --> 00:04:13,279
okay so I've drawn out a few designs and some of them I'm not going to

47
00:04:13,311 --> 00:04:15,904
use because I'm not that keen on them so

48
00:04:17,055 --> 00:04:19,808
the ones I did you like to start with I guess

49
00:04:21,183 --> 00:04:27,264
I'm quite fond of the speck design the best silhouette the Christmas pudding I think the

50
00:04:27,488 --> 00:04:29,984
Christmas ball will be good and the snowman

51
00:04:31,264 --> 00:04:36,287
possibly this I'm simple version of a Christmas tree so it'll just be a line basically

52
00:04:36,799 --> 00:04:40,000
will probably used I'm a metallic thread potentially

53
00:04:41,247 --> 00:04:45,536
and possibly on a dark fabric for it to stand out twice even in a regular

54
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:50,079
threader crow-like quite nice were just in a green so I think they're right the others

55
00:04:50,144 --> 00:04:50,144
are

56
00:04:51,231 --> 00:04:56,032
miss I think I was trying to do this squiggle version of the Christmas tree without

57
00:04:56,096 --> 00:05:00,959
growing a draft cone shape keep saying cone is the triangle shape but up during trying

58
00:05:01,023 --> 00:05:05,088
which at first so I decided up doing a squiggly line and I don't mind this

59
00:05:05,152 --> 00:05:10,847
Christmas treaty much I made possibly devote to all perhaps adapted and use as a design

60
00:05:11,552 --> 00:05:16,640
I'm there's also my first attempt at a stag which looks like a pig with and

61
00:05:16,671 --> 00:05:20,799
listen or perhaps this model I'm not sure and then I've done this which I think

62
00:05:20,992 --> 00:05:25,183
there will be quite nice idea which is them a few different Christmas buckles on the

63
00:05:25,216 --> 00:05:29,279
type but they're not really lined up very nicely and

64
00:05:30,399 --> 00:05:33,567
I think if I did do I agree to stitch buttons on and then add a

65
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:35,488
little tech to those or stitch of it

66
00:05:37,216 --> 00:05:41,055
for now I think of leaves that one I think a lot of these I'd probably

67
00:05:41,216 --> 00:05:46,239
actually preferred to and perhaps draw it and then liner up nicely on the computer so

68
00:05:46,656 --> 00:05:50,687
I have drawn them in these boxes just to make sure I don't draw them too

69
00:05:50,783 --> 00:05:54,656
big but I probably am going to mind the but better because you know it's like

70
00:05:54,687 --> 00:05:58,623
this Christmas bogle it's too far to the top that needs to move down slightly this

71
00:05:58,656 --> 00:06:01,696
her hands bit of to left and the Christmas pudding is not to babble it is

72
00:06:01,727 --> 00:06:05,536
slightly to left and yeah they're just all of it off to one side and at

73
00:06:05,567 --> 00:06:08,671
least I'm looking Uther I think correct that but it's okay I can correct it on

74
00:06:08,735 --> 00:06:12,351
this I'll just draw the outline with the box first and then I moved and trace

75
00:06:12,415 --> 00:06:17,376
this where I want it on in the rectangle against another I've chosen my designs I've

76
00:06:17,664 --> 00:06:22,752
gone around them in a black belt tip just that I can see it easier through

77
00:06:22,847 --> 00:06:26,559
my fabric and it probably comes up there on the cameras work so I've got my

78
00:06:26,687 --> 00:06:32,735
lightbox head it's and passion one with the bold Antony and you can get Hammond once

79
00:06:32,832 --> 00:06:35,903
I think now but anyway this is why I've got so that's what I'm using going

80
00:06:35,936 --> 00:06:40,415
to draw to of the designs on to this crap out of reach khalkha so I

81
00:06:40,511 --> 00:06:46,239
think for this one I might actually go for probably the bear outline and I might

82
00:06:46,303 --> 00:06:49,664
do the stag as well just but I do really like these two designs right so

83
00:06:49,791 --> 00:06:54,335
I'm going to just one around one of these and boxes and I'm really strong that

84
00:06:54,399 --> 00:06:58,816
out first so I know where my borders are and then I'm going to proceed with

85
00:06:59,071 --> 00:07:02,944
tracing my to template roughly where I want them within that box

86
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:08,608
so when you're doing pre-mission boring you have the larger

87
00:07:10,432 --> 00:07:13,536
underneath the fabric and then you get a small you can talk

88
00:07:14,752 --> 00:07:15,839
just type to the others life

89
00:07:18,592 --> 00:07:22,783
so as of his then looks while the videos I'm using that my magic pen which

90
00:07:22,976 --> 00:07:23,967
which is every reasonable

91
00:07:42,656 --> 00:07:47,679
now I'm going to meet over to the sewing machine and stitch the outlines for both

92
00:07:47,776 --> 00:07:50,111
of these so I probably just do outlines

93
00:07:51,135 --> 00:07:55,967
on this occasion and but obviously you could appliqued a both of them and me to

94
00:07:56,063 --> 00:08:00,959
get you know a suitable fabric to do the main body of the bear that would

95
00:08:01,023 --> 00:08:05,152
be quite nice and same with the stock roding you just do a silhouette of the

96
00:08:05,216 --> 00:08:05,471
stack

97
00:08:06,592 --> 00:08:08,447
yeah just move over to the sewing machine now

98
00:09:30,047 --> 00:09:34,624
he's now done all the stitching I'm just going to and trim all of those extra

99
00:09:35,359 --> 00:09:36,096
strands of thread

100
00:09:58,591 --> 00:10:04,096
a next I'm going to cut out the for panels ready to stitch the out together

101
00:10:06,176 --> 00:10:09,088
what I'm going to do is I'm going to cut one of these out one that

102
00:10:09,119 --> 00:10:10,335
I'm probably not going to use

103
00:10:14,271 --> 00:10:19,455
I'm going to place it over just to check that it's I'm coming out for exactly

104
00:10:19,487 --> 00:10:22,304
like just because my lines are about waiting to see

105
00:10:49,343 --> 00:10:54,752
don't forget the as well at least between machines which I just on it

106
00:10:59,807 --> 00:11:04,064
especially or like background you might be of to see some of the threads true so

107
00:11:04,192 --> 00:11:06,815
it's always the practice to remove them anyway

108
00:11:25,023 --> 00:11:29,408
okay so I've got my did how I would faced them long sides together they bought

109
00:11:29,567 --> 00:11:33,343
the mighty on one side and then I've got the writing on the other side I'm

110
00:11:33,408 --> 00:11:33,952
just going to

111
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:37,536
leave together well for these the crossing grips

112
00:11:44,736 --> 00:11:47,231
I'm just gonna roughly come in together and then I'm going to go back to the

113
00:11:47,263 --> 00:11:50,656
side machine and just to stitch really close to the edge

114
00:11:54,015 --> 00:11:57,823
I'm not worried about the raw edges here because it's not going to get much where

115
00:11:57,919 --> 00:12:01,536
it's not like I have an item of garment where it needs to be that secure

116
00:12:01,632 --> 00:12:04,096
of course it might for a bit but I think that would just add to it

117
00:12:04,255 --> 00:12:31,263
trunks just make the edges a bit more interesting I just use my thinking is to

118
00:12:31,872 --> 00:12:33,760
cut right place to the stitching line

119
00:12:38,432 --> 00:12:40,512
to think this is make them a bit later

120
00:12:42,143 --> 00:12:48,927
the fining thing to do realizable in different directions nothing to do is to add some

121
00:12:49,184 --> 00:12:53,280
sort of holes that I can add some wine and attach it to a gift I

122
00:12:53,375 --> 00:12:57,408
say here's the tool that my one found in a charity shop I have not used

123
00:12:57,440 --> 00:13:00,479
it before and it's from we are memory keepers

124
00:13:02,687 --> 00:13:06,880
yeah and it's a gadget little all sorts of things but I just want an island

125
00:13:06,976 --> 00:13:07,072
we

126
00:13:10,143 --> 00:13:10,880
came with it was

127
00:13:20,096 --> 00:13:26,176
so I've just got to island bases at random here they're both orange but that's

128
00:13:27,711 --> 00:13:30,047
okay so I need to work out roadies us

129
00:13:33,119 --> 00:13:36,447
the first thing I need to do is make a hole and I think need to

130
00:13:36,575 --> 00:13:40,223
use this side because it's got a smaller

131
00:13:42,367 --> 00:13:44,640
smaller it makes us more hole and these aren't huge so

132
00:13:48,127 --> 00:13:52,544
looking up in case I may be about five centimeters wiper city and

133
00:13:57,888 --> 00:14:01,312
the whole saying is I can see the spare room advice

134
00:14:02,752 --> 00:14:04,351
okay very go about

135
00:14:07,776 --> 00:14:11,168
eating as a left quite gap which is good one too

136
00:14:14,528 --> 00:14:16,447
I'm going to try out awfully that

137
00:14:21,695 --> 00:14:26,015
I guess let's talk really shop its managed to as a hole in the load of

138
00:14:26,047 --> 00:14:28,575
fabric which is great I think then

139
00:14:30,559 --> 00:14:33,984
she either on to it now I'm gonna go with a one do you think

140
00:14:35,520 --> 00:14:36,031
this works

141
00:14:41,599 --> 00:14:44,736
that I might have pressed on it to hold our fair it wouldn't do it

142
00:14:47,424 --> 00:14:49,280
okay did the one for it so

143
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:04,864
okay so they have it to tax for Christmas gifts face addressed to fill on this

144
00:15:04,960 --> 00:15:05,280
occasion

145
00:15:06,783 --> 00:15:07,296
Yep you

146
00:15:08,351 --> 00:15:12,703
so obviously if you don't have and I love whole maker and these nettled list of

147
00:15:12,768 --> 00:15:16,223
it and then you could just make a hole and it might not last as long

148
00:15:16,960 --> 00:15:21,056
it depends if you don't remove the twine which probably will last a fair about the

149
00:15:21,119 --> 00:15:21,312
time

150
00:15:24,223 --> 00:15:28,416
trying to think anything else to bear in mind obviously its white time consuming that if

151
00:15:28,447 --> 00:15:32,736
you will use the mere after year that's quite useful know they're easier if you didn't

152
00:15:32,768 --> 00:15:37,823
want to make a gift tag with a gift you're passing on someone you could use

153
00:15:37,952 --> 00:15:43,168
this method to create and little name codes for the table and which overseeing if you

154
00:15:43,231 --> 00:15:47,392
invite the same people you're on here and you'll get lots of yerselves so one main

155
00:15:47,520 --> 00:15:53,023
issue with this is you can kind of see the other side slightly for because of

156
00:15:53,088 --> 00:15:58,304
youth white like you black threads and to remain that I guess you could put a

157
00:15:58,335 --> 00:16:03,328
layer in the middle just to to hide the other side stitching possibly I don't think

158
00:16:03,392 --> 00:16:07,296
it's that bad but is something might consider in the future or perhaps I'd use a

159
00:16:07,359 --> 00:16:11,359
different colors of one side of the design so it could be you know that there

160
00:16:11,424 --> 00:16:14,815
