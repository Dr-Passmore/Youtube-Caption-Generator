00:00:00,864 --> 00:00:05,248
today I'm excited to share with you at the beach control that my mom and I

1
00:00:05,343 --> 00:00:10,784
made a few months ago so I've been avoiding editing that's just because we recorded our

2
00:00:10,847 --> 00:00:13,600
the village both on the camp order and my camera

3
00:00:14,720 --> 00:00:19,135
and a lot of matching up to do and getting it ready to release and but

4
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:25,472
I finally go on to that and finished it today so I'm excited to share it

5
00:00:25,535 --> 00:00:31,327
with you now it's all edited so basically what happened is I got two large towers

6
00:00:31,392 --> 00:00:36,352
on sale at the sleep market and I knew that my mom wanted a beach and

7
00:00:36,416 --> 00:00:41,312
how concho to born after I'm going to reach so I thought this would be the

8
00:00:41,344 --> 00:00:44,096
perfect opportunity to try it out

9
00:00:45,312 --> 00:00:45,984
I don't have many

10
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:52,223
fabric shops nearly so it's quite handy to use house it's a large enough so this

11
00:00:52,287 --> 00:00:57,728
was a brilliant opportunity to have the correct fabric for the project so yeah basically what

12
00:00:57,759 --> 00:01:01,664
will happen is I'll guide you through what we didn't so I've sped up on the

13
00:01:01,728 --> 00:01:06,463
footage because obviously it took us a few hours to make it and so I time

14
00:01:06,527 --> 00:01:09,599
up to the footage but I've done a voice-over so you know what's going on and

15
00:01:09,664 --> 00:01:12,480
I'll try and add some graphics as well just see how an idea of what I'm

16
00:01:12,543 --> 00:01:17,152
doing in case it's not there about were really happy with the end result so we'll

17
00:01:17,216 --> 00:01:19,615
put some pictures up at the ends and I have to enjoy it

18
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:32,351
so we roughly worked out how long we needed the main body peace to be so

19
00:01:32,543 --> 00:01:37,024
these towers are a hundred by a hundred and fifty centimeters so the width is a

20
00:01:37,152 --> 00:01:42,272
hundred centimeters the length is a hundred fifty we decided that it needed to be just

21
00:01:42,463 --> 00:01:48,575
over a square we made their main body length a hundred and five centimeters which meant

22
00:01:48,608 --> 00:01:54,304
we Carter forty five centimeters so we laid it out on the table and cut off

23
00:01:54,400 --> 00:02:00,031
that amount obviously we kept the bit we cut off as well just and because would

24
00:02:00,064 --> 00:02:03,680
use that later on for the hood so as you can say I'm using the fiscals

25
00:02:03,968 --> 00:02:08,544
and bit like a fabric guillotine and but it didn't work very well with the toweling

26
00:02:08,671 --> 00:02:09,311
fabric so

27
00:02:10,399 --> 00:02:13,503
we ended up going to dress making to this in the end anyway

28
00:02:15,104 --> 00:02:20,608
and because we were using strike towels we needed to ensure that the stripes

29
00:02:21,951 --> 00:02:26,367
well we kind of decided whether we wanted the stripes to match or not and you

30
00:02:26,464 --> 00:02:30,975
do need to think about the not as well with toweling fabric but it was either

31
00:02:31,039 --> 00:02:36,255
going towards one side or we decided that it didn't matter enough and that the stripes

32
00:02:36,384 --> 00:02:41,376
not matching on the shoulder seam would be more annoying so anyway so we cut the

33
00:02:41,856 --> 00:02:48,192
second howled this exactly the same way so they're both now the body pieces are hundred

34
00:02:48,287 --> 00:02:49,343
by a hundred and five

35
00:02:50,367 --> 00:02:55,552
so just to check that that fisted okay we pinned down the sides they'll be the

36
00:02:55,615 --> 00:02:59,712
future side seams and then we put I'm quitting clips

37
00:03:01,408 --> 00:03:05,184
for the shoulder seams leaving an opening for the neck

38
00:03:09,119 --> 00:03:14,304
so this is a beach cover-up that will make my mom so she can see there

39
00:03:14,399 --> 00:03:15,264
she's tried it on

40
00:03:16,287 --> 00:03:21,119
and were just looking at how the neckline should work so we decided that it just

41
00:03:21,151 --> 00:03:26,591
needed to be around the collar bone so there's me doing a fabric mark just where

42
00:03:26,944 --> 00:03:28,479
we think it should be cut

43
00:03:30,399 --> 00:03:34,399
okay so then we after and an awful lot about the hood

44
00:03:36,479 --> 00:03:36,863
and

45
00:03:37,919 --> 00:03:46,399
basically I've fast forwarded this really quick we spent ages having a look just I'm judging

46
00:03:46,464 --> 00:03:48,160
it by I pinning it

47
00:03:49,311 --> 00:03:57,248
trying to make a luxurious looking hood really catastrophically failing so in the and so we

48
00:03:57,600 --> 00:03:58,783
we kept pinning it

49
00:03:59,871 --> 00:04:06,496
and yeah in the end we decided that it was best a copy of a simple

50
00:04:06,656 --> 00:04:12,895
hood from something we had at home so what we had at home was a nice

51
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:17,855
hoodie of mine okay so what we did was I'm as you can see yetts made

52
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:22,048
out of to pieces this hood so it was a really nice one to trace so

53
00:04:22,272 --> 00:04:27,071
we got some scrap paper to use and place the hood on top of that and

54
00:04:27,104 --> 00:04:32,671
then we drew around the head marking and all the edges that you can see we

55
00:04:32,735 --> 00:04:37,247
did add a seam allowance to the I'm back of the hood and the front

56
00:04:38,687 --> 00:04:43,135
we hadn't added one to the base so that's what we did that and but after

57
00:04:43,295 --> 00:04:49,023
measuring it up with the and what was on I'm the opening of the beach dress

58
00:04:49,183 --> 00:04:54,208
and neck opening we actually had to add three centimeters just as it and completely match

59
00:04:54,303 --> 00:04:59,231
up with the hood word chosen right so happy with I'm the template that was created

60
00:04:59,391 --> 00:05:04,992
we then cut out the two head pieces so and we folded it over here we

61
00:05:05,055 --> 00:05:09,696
did actually in the end it out again could we didn't pay attention to the stripes

62
00:05:11,552 --> 00:05:16,320
so once would cut out the two hood pieces and there I am using the overlocker

63
00:05:17,023 --> 00:05:21,791
and I'm overlocking the curved back seem of the hood

64
00:05:28,256 --> 00:05:32,992
right so we're happy with the hip there that fill in the background just looking around

65
00:05:33,088 --> 00:05:33,951
wondering what's going on

66
00:05:35,071 --> 00:05:37,536
we will say nicked his chair though which is why he's kneeling

67
00:05:38,976 --> 00:05:43,231
see I were happy with the hood so the next thing we decided to do

68
00:05:44,671 --> 00:05:47,359
was work out exactly where the hood would go

69
00:05:59,455 --> 00:06:07,231
here I'm overlooking the shoulder seems so I'm going from the end of the neck opening

70
00:06:07,455 --> 00:06:14,656
to where the armhole openings and then I repeated it with the other shoulder seam as

71
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:14,911
well

72
00:06:22,496 --> 00:06:24,256
okay so with that done we then

73
00:06:25,279 --> 00:06:27,839
went about to attach the hood so

74
00:06:29,343 --> 00:06:32,992
what we did at the front was we did cut down to where I marked the

75
00:06:33,088 --> 00:06:34,880
collarbone so I've got

76
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:41,791
a nice opening their so yeah then we just lined it up in the center and

77
00:06:41,855 --> 00:06:43,040
pinned it all the way around

78
00:06:49,407 --> 00:06:54,335
once we pinned it we then tucked it into place and just because the toweling fabric

79
00:06:54,463 --> 00:06:59,455
does move about quite a lot and so it is quite challenging to work with and

80
00:06:59,488 --> 00:07:04,832
it is really think even on the overlocker which is fairly adaptable to most stuff it

81
00:07:04,895 --> 00:07:06,208
was struggling a little bit

82
00:07:25,279 --> 00:07:31,135
so before we attached the head we did check it an honor to another fitting just

83
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:31,936
to double check

84
00:07:33,279 --> 00:07:37,312
just because it would be alright night manner to you on pick so we thought better

85
00:07:37,791 --> 00:07:41,951
safe we will say double-checks and how the armholes would be

86
00:08:24,895 --> 00:08:25,791
a that was the moment we

87
00:08:26,847 --> 00:08:33,567
realized that the perfect pocket for it would be a kangaroo pouch bucket so here we

88
00:08:33,695 --> 00:08:37,823
are just roughly working out where we want it to go on the beach dress

89
00:08:42,208 --> 00:08:47,616
so here I am just taking some measurements so we pinned it where my mom thinks

90
00:08:47,711 --> 00:08:54,528
it would hang best and I'm scribbling some rough measurements I think we ended up tweaking

91
00:08:54,624 --> 00:08:59,168
this as we drehte out but just to give us a rough idea of how we

92
00:08:59,263 --> 00:09:03,487
were going to do it right with a rough idea of the measurements and we then

93
00:09:04,768 --> 00:09:05,471
drew out

94
00:09:06,528 --> 00:09:08,096
the kangaroo pouch to scale

95
00:09:14,687 --> 00:09:18,752
as you can see we were adjusting as we went along we decided that the original

96
00:09:18,815 --> 00:09:21,343
measurements weren't narrow enough at the top

97
00:09:22,559 --> 00:09:27,872
so we ended up increasing the lower their the base of the pocket and shortening the

98
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:31,104
top edge just to give it more of

99
00:09:32,479 --> 00:09:38,080
yes sir an angle for the pockets he ended up drawing out in a different pen

100
00:09:38,304 --> 00:09:43,007
just the region which was the correct line to castle right say next week cut out

101
00:09:43,231 --> 00:09:44,831
the patch pocket

102
00:09:52,831 --> 00:09:57,952
and here I am overlocking all the edges just so it won't fray I don't think

103
00:09:57,984 --> 00:10:00,736
we bothered with the top one because it was one of the

104
00:10:02,208 --> 00:10:04,640
original ends of the towel

105
00:10:05,728 --> 00:10:12,351
so now here I am just marking up some prep folding in the seam allowance as

106
00:10:12,416 --> 00:10:17,536
its patch pocket so that we don't have any role Rogers edges on the outside

107
00:10:36,096 --> 00:10:42,911
and then there's my mom she's just talking so she's just taking the pressed in the

108
00:10:43,007 --> 00:10:47,744
folded in edge that we've just created and again just so it doesn't move what we're

109
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:49,567
trying to stitch it on to

110
00:10:50,591 --> 00:10:54,911
the main peace

111
00:11:19,776 --> 00:11:27,359
with that tact we then went about guessing it's positioned on to the front of the

112
00:11:27,583 --> 00:11:32,223
towel cover-up so here I am just pinning it all the way around so that we've

113
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:36,992
got it there before you attach it to the front peace you do need to stitch

114
00:11:37,632 --> 00:11:40,640
where the pockets open so the two

115
00:11:41,728 --> 00:11:46,719
diagonal lines so you just need to do a straight stitch on this I did actually

116
00:11:46,783 --> 00:11:49,599
forget to do this so we ended up hand-stitching it

117
00:11:50,815 --> 00:11:56,895
which I wouldn't recommend I just do it on the machine if you don't forget so

118
00:11:57,056 --> 00:12:03,135
once I'd pinned it on to the front peace I then attacked him to position again

119
00:12:03,359 --> 00:12:08,000
like I say it I just didn't want to moving around too much and I felt

120
00:12:08,159 --> 00:12:10,976
it was a lot safer to spend the time attacking

121
00:12:13,599 --> 00:12:19,583
right with it attacked in place I then used the sewing machine to stitch the top

122
00:12:20,927 --> 00:12:26,719
side and the lower side interposition as well as the two

123
00:12:28,192 --> 00:12:36,703
vertical lines on the sides of the pockets just before the diagonal lines web and which

124
00:12:36,768 --> 00:12:38,943
are where their hands go into the pocket

125
00:12:45,664 --> 00:12:49,856
with that in place I then pinned the sides together we left a little gap at

126
00:12:49,919 --> 00:12:50,432
the bottom

127
00:12:56,992 --> 00:12:59,872
and you're using the pen more pinned markers that we're done

128
00:13:00,927 --> 00:13:01,791
we then added

129
00:13:03,679 --> 00:13:08,127
we ensure that we didn't stitch over the armholes right so with the side stitched up

130
00:13:08,575 --> 00:13:12,447
the final thing we had to do was a bias binding to the front opening where

131
00:13:12,512 --> 00:13:16,223
we'd just cut down to the collar bone we didn't have to do on the hood

132
00:13:16,447 --> 00:13:20,768
if you did to cut your heads on a raw edge I'd recommend put and vice

133
00:13:20,831 --> 00:13:24,671
finding all the way round the hood as well as the neck opening but as we'd

134
00:13:24,736 --> 00:13:29,504
only done it on that lower section and the bit I guessed from the neck to

135
00:13:29,567 --> 00:13:32,671
the collarbone we just had to do it on that be shaped bit there

136
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:38,239
again so I hope you enjoyed the footage of the beach I'll punch of being made

137
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:42,271
so we have a lot of fun creating it as you noticed we have to

138
00:13:43,424 --> 00:13:47,200
think about it as we made it up but obviously if you did follow these instructions

139
00:13:47,231 --> 00:13:49,151
you could probably make it in a much and short a time

140
00:13:50,239 --> 00:13:53,856
with the town in ferity do need to be careful just does it quite thick so

141
00:13:53,984 --> 00:13:58,943
you've got a basic machine you might struggle unless you had a walking fit and yeah

142
00:13:59,072 --> 00:14:03,679
I found that tacking really helped me get through it and and it did struggle on

143
00:14:03,807 --> 00:14:08,031
the overlocker events so you just need to make Jordan's you know you're feeling that you

144
00:14:08,159 --> 00:14:14,848
live the fabric together appropriately so yeah we took a couple of vota among wearing it

145
00:14:15,104 --> 00:14:20,512
and more recently YMCAs of the sovereign the moments in the UK so we managed to

146
00:14:20,607 --> 00:14:23,840
snap the a shot of her wearing the beach on Joe on the beach which was

147
00:14:23,903 --> 00:14:28,864
lovely and that we do obviously had some pictures we took colony fat finished making it

148
00:14:28,927 --> 00:14:33,567
as well so we're really happy with the result it's a nice comfy I'd say it's

149
00:14:33,664 --> 00:14:37,471
quite the universal size of well so have you know I tried it on and a

150
00:14:37,567 --> 00:14:42,880
slightly different and shape and size and I found it really comfortable as well I think

151
00:14:43,104 --> 00:14:48,864
the any difference if you're making it the different sizes you might want to consider shortening

152
00:14:48,927 --> 00:14:53,567
it a bit more and if there's someone is really putties or you might want to

153
00:14:53,664 --> 00:15:00,159
move the I'm the pocket peace a bit higher or lower depending on that person's body

154
00:15:00,255 --> 00:15:04,320
light and but they're probably the main adjustment spend much meant to make him very still

155
00:15:04,864 --> 00:15:10,304
keep the neck opening pretty much the same and to the local very work for most

156
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:14,719
people another thing to consider is the weight of the towels or the thickness of the

157
00:15:14,783 --> 00:15:20,127
town's that you're using we used quite substantial towels so although it nice and cozy an

158
00:15:20,192 --> 00:15:24,031
absorbent if it was a really what they might get a bit too how after a

159
00:15:24,096 --> 00:15:28,192
while I think of the barn in the beach and called all day you're quite shoaled

160
00:15:28,288 --> 00:15:32,351
