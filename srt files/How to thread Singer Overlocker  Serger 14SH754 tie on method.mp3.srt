today I'm going to show you how you can read your overlocker with the tight on

1
00:00:05,056 --> 00:00:07,967
methods as always that you like this video it might seem or please don't forget to

2
00:00:08,031 --> 00:00:12,064
like and subscribe if you haven't already as I mentioned before I've got the singer fourteen

3
00:00:12,159 --> 00:00:17,728
as to age seven five for model this is a budget overlocker machine and I thought

4
00:00:17,791 --> 00:00:22,431
it might be quite useful just to show how you can thread the overlocker so there

5
00:00:22,527 --> 00:00:27,936
are two methods there's the I'm try on method when you cut this I'm your current

6
00:00:27,968 --> 00:00:32,352
threats you tie your new color on and then you put it through the machine and

7
00:00:32,416 --> 00:00:38,080
then there is the other version where you read it completely from scratch so today I'm

8
00:00:38,144 --> 00:00:41,984
going to show you the tire methods I do only have three overlooker sense in here

9
00:00:42,048 --> 00:00:47,647
at the moment I'm missing one of the needles but that's fine it's so it's the

10
00:00:47,743 --> 00:00:51,872
same method if you had for you just have an additional needle thread so for this

11
00:00:52,096 --> 00:00:56,512
you will need some scissors so I've just got my embroidery ones just because they're the

12
00:00:56,543 --> 00:01:02,048
supersharp and I quite like using him and for some tweezers preferably the ones that came

13
00:01:02,111 --> 00:01:07,232
with your overlocker or once designed for an oval are that just because they're the right

14
00:01:07,328 --> 00:01:11,935
shape if that makes them quickly before you start changing the threads on your overlocker be

15
00:01:12,031 --> 00:01:15,071
sure to make sure that it is switched off to first thing I'm going to do

16
00:01:15,872 --> 00:01:19,232
is I'm going to move all of the dials to zero

17
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:26,304
so I'm the needle for the blue thread on my machine that ones already on zero

18
00:01:26,367 --> 00:01:29,727
because I don't have the left needle in place of the moment

19
00:01:31,136 --> 00:01:35,008
but I'm going to move the other ones and a good tip for this is to

20
00:01:35,232 --> 00:01:39,968
take a photo of your current tension settings now east will still need to test your

21
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:40,928
attention when you

22
00:01:41,952 --> 00:01:46,143
have the new threats in place and it will always depend on what fabric you got

23
00:01:46,783 --> 00:01:50,047
but it is really still to do that because it could be that

24
00:01:51,136 --> 00:01:54,304
you know the tension is still fine and then at least you know what settings you

25
00:01:54,367 --> 00:01:58,431
had originally so when mine I've got the best for three three I'm not actually in

26
00:01:58,463 --> 00:02:01,695
the noted down this time because I was testing out a wrong man and that to

27
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:04,800
happen to use it as a road hand this time

28
00:02:05,984 --> 00:02:08,832
so I'm just going to put it to zero and then I'll probably just put it

29
00:02:08,863 --> 00:02:14,240
to the standard settings for this machine which is to put all of the tension disks

30
00:02:14,335 --> 00:02:15,039
to three

31
00:02:16,479 --> 00:02:21,951
it's not their own on zero or a plastic line on this case you then need

32
00:02:21,983 --> 00:02:25,824
to cut your threats at the top so I'm just gonna cut them about halfway

33
00:02:29,472 --> 00:02:30,399
and then you can remove them

34
00:02:33,632 --> 00:02:38,656
I'm going to add my new threats so I'm just going to do a simple double

35
00:02:39,039 --> 00:02:39,296
not

36
00:02:40,703 --> 00:02:41,727
but I will just make sure

37
00:02:42,751 --> 00:02:45,600
it's tight enough so that white undy when I fall the registry

38
00:02:55,391 --> 00:03:00,703
case now I've put all of my black thread tied onto the end of the white

39
00:03:00,735 --> 00:03:04,447
threads that were in there I've got the attention just to zero so that there won't

40
00:03:04,479 --> 00:03:08,735
be any friction when they moved through and just games a check that the at all

41
00:03:08,832 --> 00:03:09,408
open this man

42
00:03:11,615 --> 00:03:15,871
and this against it that the needle is up properly so it's fully up so that

43
00:03:15,936 --> 00:03:16,960
won't get in the way either

44
00:03:18,304 --> 00:03:23,199
now all I've got left to do is to draw and thread through Oh I need

45
00:03:23,231 --> 00:03:25,184
to move the oppressor but up as well

46
00:03:28,384 --> 00:03:31,423
as that would get it in the way so what you do is

47
00:03:32,544 --> 00:03:33,503
you find the end

48
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:35,520
and you just

49
00:03:37,024 --> 00:03:38,432
carefully through

50
00:03:40,671 --> 00:03:43,360
so might they might be about a fraction at the top when it goes through the

51
00:03:43,744 --> 00:03:47,488
the little metal guides at the top sometimes that can affect a

52
00:03:55,072 --> 00:03:57,408
case of the lower loopers will just come Terry nicely

53
00:03:58,464 --> 00:04:02,432
and then you just cut off the excess you have to be a bit careful with

54
00:04:02,527 --> 00:04:07,807
the needle threat just because you can't get the not through the eye of the needle

55
00:04:08,095 --> 00:04:11,583
what you'll need to than once you've cut off the end of the white red

56
00:04:12,608 --> 00:04:16,575
you will then need to put it out of the needle and then cut the loss

57
00:04:16,671 --> 00:04:16,799
off

58
00:04:17,824 --> 00:04:22,816
and then you can use your Keyes's to rethread that back in place

59
00:04:29,023 --> 00:04:31,712
so something I got tourte is to have your

60
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:36,992
lupa's reds and at the front here and you put your

61
00:04:38,144 --> 00:04:44,895
needle threads towards back and before you put your press of it back down finally so

62
00:04:44,992 --> 00:04:46,111
you can close that up

63
00:04:47,135 --> 00:04:51,648
but the next thing you need to do is to put your attention disks back up

64
00:04:51,808 --> 00:04:56,160
to and whatever something you did have previously or in my case I'm going to put

65
00:04:56,223 --> 00:04:59,872
it to three so that I can then when I got money fabric an I can

66
00:04:59,936 --> 00:05:04,608
make out what the correct tension into the particular fabric so you haven't that's definitely the

67
00:05:04,735 --> 00:05:11,776
simplest way to rethread your overlocker it's not less painful than rethreading it from stretch if

68
00:05:11,839 --> 00:05:16,640
you can do that if the tensions completely finally haven't snapped any of the threats this

69
00:05:16,735 --> 00:05:22,144
is the method I've definitely recommend however if you are having issues for tension or any

70
00:05:22,208 --> 00:05:27,391
other problems with your opa-locka I would definitely recommend rethreading its and scratches that can at

71
00:05:27,455 --> 00:05:32,544
least emit some of the potential problems you're having that's it for this time thanks for

72
00:05:32,608 --> 00:05:32,895
watching
