say I'm reviewing the shorts pattern from the calls nine great looks one easy happen which

1
00:00:07,039 --> 00:00:11,008
is number seven six seven five as always that you like this video would like see

2
00:00:11,104 --> 00:00:15,039
more please don't forget to like and describe with you had already so other mentioned this

3
00:00:15,104 --> 00:00:21,503
is the Mikhoels passed in it is number seven six five I've done variation jail no

4
00:00:21,631 --> 00:00:26,431
not exactly because I have a Dondi trimming on the hem and the side I've made

5
00:00:26,527 --> 00:00:28,672
in the fourteen which I think on this person

6
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:34,560
Oh no I think it does come in other sizes but essentially just cart around the

7
00:00:34,624 --> 00:00:39,423
pattern because I'm the size fourteen was the largest one and

8
00:00:40,543 --> 00:00:45,152
it's actually a medium on here okay so mediums at twelve or fourteen is a lot

9
00:00:45,215 --> 00:00:49,728
the one I've done maybe once the fabric this is a run of public ahead of

10
00:00:49,791 --> 00:00:53,152
my stash I'd originally made my partners in pajamas or without this and I thought it

11
00:00:53,183 --> 00:00:57,375
might be nice to make matching half myself out of the different chooks have to get

12
00:00:57,888 --> 00:01:03,776
it is a Corso and woven fabric it's quite a lightweight one just des standard underside

13
00:01:03,807 --> 00:01:08,608
cotton fabric and I believe I originally got it from a fabric land one of their

14
00:01:08,704 --> 00:01:13,152
stores in times of difficulty this is a nice super easy pattern so if you have

15
00:01:13,216 --> 00:01:16,767
an ancient the board it's definitely a good one to start with it's not too difficult

16
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:21,344
to make you cut out a front and back peace and these stitched together like you

17
00:01:21,407 --> 00:01:26,751
only wood for shorts or trousers and then you've got this nice elasticated voice is so

18
00:01:26,847 --> 00:01:31,008
it's very easy to sort out the it there are different variations on the past and

19
00:01:31,071 --> 00:01:33,472
so you can make it and little bit woke up place if you want what you

20
00:01:33,503 --> 00:01:37,536
can do except what I've done it and just make a simple Harry shorts without any

21
00:01:37,664 --> 00:01:42,400
panels that the side or adding a panel of him or adding any trimming or a

22
00:01:42,463 --> 00:01:46,496
bit of course at the front you can just literally have been like this all they

23
00:01:46,624 --> 00:01:52,064
say that I have added the ensign pockets because it's nice to have a kiss it

24
00:01:52,096 --> 00:01:55,615
was also have a variation we add patch pockets to the front as well but I

25
00:01:55,744 --> 00:02:01,888
thought these would be as frangible for me the clarity of instructions they are super simple

26
00:02:02,143 --> 00:02:06,463
clear instructions I had no problem with it although I thought to be honest I didn't

27
00:02:06,527 --> 00:02:12,639
realize that the elasticated channel originally was to separatists elastic so you actually got to travel

28
00:02:12,671 --> 00:02:18,207
with of elastica and I remember how white the last to confirm its half an enjoyed

29
00:02:18,272 --> 00:02:19,839
so one point to some cases

30
00:02:21,376 --> 00:02:26,464
the first couple of times I made a I just used I wanted vitalistic and just

31
00:02:26,527 --> 00:02:30,016
created one big channel which is obviously fine but I actually quite like it with the

32
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:34,464
two channels nothing had some extra little diesel but as I say I don't think it's

33
00:02:34,591 --> 00:02:38,944
really the passionate folks it's quite clear and and it does really states that there are

34
00:02:39,039 --> 00:02:42,783
two channels sexual said do so I'm not sure how I miss that but it's differently

35
00:02:42,848 --> 00:02:46,751
of me in terms of design and fits as I mentioned it is quite a casual

36
00:02:47,007 --> 00:02:51,072
least bit design which is why I like making this one with the Germans beg you

37
00:02:51,136 --> 00:02:54,527
could definitely where it just as shorts and the seven I really like the fact that

38
00:02:54,591 --> 00:02:58,880
it's going option for inosine pockets and they are nice really once on their of what's

39
00:02:58,944 --> 00:03:03,231
behind us I accidentally stick the seems so that they were pointing backwards to start with

40
00:03:03,871 --> 00:03:07,167
so that's the reason it's only the longer to take these I don't have to one

41
00:03:07,264 --> 00:03:11,488
ticket I do like the fact that gives you a few different variations to create so

42
00:03:11,936 --> 00:03:15,936
I think it would look nice with a contrast panel especially to use a couple of

43
00:03:15,968 --> 00:03:21,472
playing fabrics or playing of other to the main pieces and then maybe a proper pass

44
00:03:21,535 --> 00:03:25,727
and fabric down the side I've made the variation when you add the panel at the

45
00:03:26,207 --> 00:03:29,951
bottom as well of the shorts which looks nice especially infuse that a stroke to that

46
00:03:29,983 --> 00:03:34,912
broke and do it that strikes the other way for the lower section I haven't tried

47
00:03:34,975 --> 00:03:38,880
it with the lace and that I'm not sure what there I will but I keep

48
00:03:38,944 --> 00:03:42,399
coming back to this passen and so few next the time take him and either leader

49
00:03:42,527 --> 00:03:46,848
to I went wrong but I made this particular pair it's definitely one who could make

50
00:03:46,944 --> 00:03:50,656
it an afternoon and someone who's really quick and so will probably do it within an

51
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:57,279
hour's foulest but yeah I've managed to accidentally I think I was thinking normally if you

52
00:03:57,759 --> 00:04:03,679
search the scenes together at the side you press them towards the back peace and because

53
00:04:03,839 --> 00:04:07,296
I had added the ensign pockets you can't do that you need to push them towards

54
00:04:07,391 --> 00:04:12,095
the front so I managed to press it that way I did the elasticated pacing which

55
00:04:12,192 --> 00:04:17,088
then secured the pockets facing backwards but obviously no were really that and the little get

56
00:04:17,152 --> 00:04:22,816
some ways that that way it's not very comfortable and so I had the topic there

57
00:04:23,071 --> 00:04:29,055
elasticated channel at the two sides enough to then flip the pockets the right way but

58
00:04:29,503 --> 00:04:33,376
it does mean that because I know nothing all of the elasticated channel because I didn't

59
00:04:33,727 --> 00:04:37,567
so I get it does mean that it looks quite messy were of research and so

60
00:04:38,144 --> 00:04:42,335
I'm probably if I pause I'm going to wear this as the dramas I would have

61
00:04:42,528 --> 00:04:46,272
unpicked it all done much need to read in the past it and it would look

62
00:04:46,368 --> 00:04:51,007
better but because I'm just wearing these you invented the speed Ahriman's I don't really mind

63
00:04:51,104 --> 00:04:55,135
that it doesn't completely line up at the slides so to conclude if you can find

64
00:04:55,231 --> 00:04:59,071
this after that somewhere I don't know somewhere online or in a shop to shop I

65
00:04:59,264 --> 00:05:03,519
recommended it is a nice and Cixous white make which is the reason why I decided

66
00:05:03,552 --> 00:05:07,167
to come back to this particular projects I thought yellow light simple in the project or

67
00:05:07,231 --> 00:05:11,104
they did manage to go wrong on it that's it for this time thanks for watching
