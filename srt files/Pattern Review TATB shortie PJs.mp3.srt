00:00:00,639 --> 00:00:04,671
today I'm reviewing the shorty pajamas by to the in the button if you like this

1
00:00:04,736 --> 00:00:07,903
video and would like to see more please they forget to like unsubscribe if you haven't

2
00:00:07,935 --> 00:00:12,288
already so this person is from that make it simple back which is their most recent

3
00:00:12,352 --> 00:00:17,856
of it at that time of recording so I went for the short sleeved Germans because

4
00:00:17,983 --> 00:00:21,920
I thought we're getting toward the summer I thought they'd be nice to make another key

5
00:00:22,687 --> 00:00:28,895
waiting was that I had only just about enough of this yellow fabric to makes the

6
00:00:28,959 --> 00:00:33,631
short so you might recognize this fabric from when I made to be kinda cardigan so

7
00:00:33,728 --> 00:00:37,183
if I made it out with the remnants from that and I just about have enough

8
00:00:37,312 --> 00:00:42,784
which was fabulous spoke for the shorts you have to create the person yourself or rather

9
00:00:42,911 --> 00:00:49,152
adapted from the trouser version of the Juno pajamas so for this you essentially just I'm

10
00:00:49,472 --> 00:00:54,816
hacker and cut up at the length you want so I have done an inside like

11
00:00:54,880 --> 00:00:57,855
seem of twelve centimeters within the book I think it

12
00:01:00,256 --> 00:01:04,863
she did six monthly to so I don't double the book just because I'm more comfortable

13
00:01:04,896 --> 00:01:09,024
with this length at the top it's actually the Tabatha t-shirt in the book but there

14
00:01:09,152 --> 00:01:13,407
shortly pajamas and that shone in the book they've just on the road Atisha but I

15
00:01:13,503 --> 00:01:19,487
have added to variation on the top of the way you add up and sleep cuffs

16
00:01:19,872 --> 00:01:23,295
it's also worth noting that I made a size for about the top and the bottom

17
00:01:23,519 --> 00:01:28,351
over he mentions the fabric I used for the autumns for the top I got this

18
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:35,136
fabric from trader which is one of my local fabric triggers boys interesting is a hit

19
00:01:35,167 --> 00:01:40,832
amiss and sometimes so-called backs of good stuff other times it's really hard to find anything

20
00:01:40,928 --> 00:01:44,608
useful in the job but I already went on a good day and it's actually a

21
00:01:44,671 --> 00:01:50,559
really nice fabric it feels really soft and it's a single ordinate fabric so it's quite

22
00:01:50,655 --> 00:01:50,879
thin

23
00:01:52,127 --> 00:01:55,648
and it does mean that it's a bit more chundering to work with just because the

24
00:01:55,776 --> 00:02:00,704
ends color but it feels really nice to wear and I'm hoping it will wash nicely

25
00:02:00,767 --> 00:02:05,856
as well for their rubbing I brought this especially from I believe it's my fabrics the

26
00:02:05,919 --> 00:02:10,880
online source so mighty relays don't exactly match but all it would be nice to have

27
00:02:10,944 --> 00:02:14,815
a bit of coordination between the top or bottom and times a difficulty I'd say it's

28
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:20,703
good for a constant beginner it's a nice simple make and it came together really well

29
00:02:20,832 --> 00:02:24,447
I did not still any unpicking I think the main thing that a beginner might find

30
00:02:24,511 --> 00:02:30,591
challenging beyond the usual challenges you go with a knit fabric would be adding the neckbands

31
00:02:30,912 --> 00:02:36,095
because if you do have an issue with the size of the next fountaining lying flat

32
00:02:36,608 --> 00:02:40,384
and that can think of it frustrating and but saying that the instructions and I sent

33
00:02:40,416 --> 00:02:45,024
clear and you guide you on that something I did do on this and which probably

34
00:02:45,151 --> 00:02:51,167
added all of it a time is I did machine tack the neck found one first

35
00:02:51,264 --> 00:02:55,423
just to make sure that it was the right size just because I tend to use

36
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:56,160
my overlocker

37
00:02:57,216 --> 00:03:00,960
after that when I want I'm happy with the bits and it would be a lot

38
00:03:01,024 --> 00:03:06,399
harder to unpick if it wasn't correct in the same like the waist bands and is

39
00:03:06,464 --> 00:03:09,087
attached similar to the neckbands in the sense to you

40
00:03:10,848 --> 00:03:16,384
identify that you you know you quarter the elastic and then you much up with the

41
00:03:16,447 --> 00:03:20,320
scenes on the shorts and then you need to stretch are generally to attach with these

42
00:03:20,384 --> 00:03:24,544
as well you then fold over to encase the elastic on the inside and then you

43
00:03:24,608 --> 00:03:29,503
have to stretch it that you then do is in battle and to enable it to

44
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:32,768
stitch it in place and that could be a bit changes well I was a bit

45
00:03:32,832 --> 00:03:37,087
concerned well that's H doing it evenly but I'm quite pleased with promise to end up

46
00:03:37,248 --> 00:03:41,440
the clarity of instructions I think I said it every single time I've reviewed the to

47
00:03:41,632 --> 00:03:46,399
the Orson's passing which has been quite a few now it's really clear and nice to

48
00:03:46,527 --> 00:03:51,264
read so in this book you do have a checklist of instructions which is a much

49
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:55,904
more shorthand version and you also have the much more detailed long hands instruction for with

50
00:03:55,968 --> 00:04:01,087
the trousers I actually falling to the longhand instructions but for the top I volleyed the

51
00:04:01,151 --> 00:04:06,080
checklist both worth nice to follow that the checklist version with the top I did every

52
00:04:06,143 --> 00:04:10,591
now and look at the more detailed insurrection just don't wish I promise doing everything and

53
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:14,175
the way I thought I should add that was useful to design and fit I'm pretty

54
00:04:14,304 --> 00:04:19,808
happy with that's because it tells you how to measure out the elastic for your own

55
00:04:20,032 --> 00:04:24,415
measurements it will receive means that you get a nice comfortable for thalassic for these will

56
00:04:24,511 --> 00:04:29,312
find so that seems to work on the track as your drafting the shorts you get

57
00:04:29,343 --> 00:04:34,208
so choose the length so that worked out nicely so I've cut these at length which

58
00:04:34,335 --> 00:04:38,752
uncomfortable with and also that I could get out of the fabric moment I have already

59
00:04:38,847 --> 00:04:39,231
like the

60
00:04:40,287 --> 00:04:44,063
I'm caught found on here actually I think it just some other mentioned it as a

61
00:04:44,096 --> 00:04:49,055
bit of pondered to this of always quiet white t-shirt and it goes in nicely with

62
00:04:49,119 --> 00:04:52,640
the short beyond that to say this is quite a simple plain teacher so it's a

63
00:04:52,671 --> 00:04:58,752
good staple what you like wearing t-shirts it's quite similar to the peak t-shirts that I

64
00:04:58,816 --> 00:05:01,951
made recently when I make my you can stop both are quite good in the sense

65
00:05:02,048 --> 00:05:07,903
that you can use them as a blank canvas to then embellish or make your own

66
00:05:08,127 --> 00:05:14,399
we've match the shorts they're based about an inch below your waist so and which is

67
00:05:14,463 --> 00:05:20,864
quite a nice level particularly of pajamas so other mentioned they seem fine and I think

68
00:05:21,279 --> 00:05:27,328
it'll that's quite well the time taken as a book suggests this the minutes for casting

69
00:05:27,391 --> 00:05:30,847
out including drafting the pattern for the short

70
00:05:31,872 --> 00:05:36,320
for me it took more like an hour and a half I have mentioned before I'm

71
00:05:36,415 --> 00:05:40,223
quite slow at cutting out one thing that might have made it a bit longer for

72
00:05:40,287 --> 00:05:44,032
me was because I was using a run-in piece of fabric I couldn't cut on the

73
00:05:44,096 --> 00:05:48,544
phone for the shorts I had to cut each piece separately again ever read and taking

74
00:05:48,575 --> 00:05:52,640
an extra forty minutes to do that I think that is just I'm slower than the

75
00:05:52,768 --> 00:05:58,335
average speed of those who decided on the time for the book the serving time it

76
00:05:58,432 --> 00:06:02,816
suggests two hours it took me three hours I did at the

77
00:06:04,223 --> 00:06:09,727
cuff and on here so I guess that added but trying potentially although the snow look

78
00:06:09,791 --> 00:06:14,335
up to him press stuck and switch the hand so I'm not sure how much time

79
00:06:14,399 --> 00:06:18,335
would have really added I did asked that extra step of attacking the neck found on

80
00:06:18,623 --> 00:06:23,295
as well so attention that might earth as it on a bit of time again I

81
00:06:23,359 --> 00:06:28,287
don't think it really all about it quite as much time again I don't think it's

82
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:34,111
quite a whole extra hour or so I think it's just that I'm a lot slower

83
00:06:34,592 --> 00:06:38,752
and suggests that a as I mentioned before my birth particle review it might be that

84
00:06:38,783 --> 00:06:43,679
you get the quicker their more time to make up for these persons the overall I'm

85
00:06:43,743 --> 00:06:47,424
really happy with these I haven't yet worn these as pajamas so I guess that will

86
00:06:47,519 --> 00:06:47,584
be

87
00:06:48,768 --> 00:06:51,808
the promise of us on how ductile they are but because they're me now than that

88
00:06:51,872 --> 00:06:56,000
fabric I'm expecting them to be pretty nice to where I'm thinking of adding a bit

89
00:06:56,063 --> 00:07:00,223
of handed broidery to the top just had a bit more detail from making this top

90
00:07:00,351 --> 00:07:03,519
for the bananas I think I would have another go at it or making just a

91
00:07:03,552 --> 00:07:07,808
t-shirt to where every day as well as I mentioned both is of the peak teacher

92
00:07:07,936 --> 00:07:11,967
a really good ones for you know creating your own top that's it for today thanks

93
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:12,480
for watching
