hello today I'm revealing the new Meghan Nilsson pattern the jar a jumper

1
00:00:15,680 --> 00:00:19,871
I was fortunate enough to be able to pass and test this so I made it

2
00:00:19,968 --> 00:00:24,447
a few months ago and so I'm excited to be able to finally share it

3
00:00:26,143 --> 00:00:30,527
just a quick disclaimer at the beginning if I'm squinting at all it's just because I've

4
00:00:30,624 --> 00:00:36,543
got I wrote us at the moment in order to treat I write us you have

5
00:00:36,608 --> 00:00:41,088
to take a couple of different eyedrops one of which for the first week or so

6
00:00:41,951 --> 00:00:46,976
dilating ones so it means that I've got one people that's way bigger than the other

7
00:00:47,487 --> 00:00:49,055
I'm not sure if I can show it

8
00:00:55,807 --> 00:00:57,439
basically it means that

9
00:00:59,136 --> 00:01:01,504
one eye is getting loads of light

10
00:01:02,527 --> 00:01:07,615
into it and the other one other people's really small when its bright but yet just

11
00:01:07,648 --> 00:01:09,823
one of the joys of the chronic illness I have

12
00:01:10,879 --> 00:01:14,047
so now I'm just going to go through the pass and details so this is the

13
00:01:14,143 --> 00:01:21,120
jarra pattern by Megan Nelson I made you a which is a simple jumper format of

14
00:01:21,248 --> 00:01:28,223
the main details is that it's got ribbing on the neck the cut and also the

15
00:01:28,608 --> 00:01:28,863
hem

16
00:01:30,624 --> 00:01:35,872
there are some other interesting versions that you can do with this pattern there's a little

17
00:01:35,935 --> 00:01:42,527
time not you can have them besides there's a high-low him version which is curved and

18
00:01:42,624 --> 00:01:49,632
they also now released a funnel neck version which was a suggestion as the passant Esther

19
00:01:49,823 --> 00:01:54,367
but they didn't have the pieces for it so and to be honest if I did

20
00:01:54,431 --> 00:01:57,120
make it again I'd be very tempted to make that version

21
00:01:58,272 --> 00:02:01,248
and finally the size that I made was the size ten

22
00:02:02,688 --> 00:02:08,608
for this pattern I used charity shops finds for the whole of it and the end

23
00:02:09,055 --> 00:02:12,000
this light gray ribbing that I've got here

24
00:02:13,055 --> 00:02:14,464
I actually got this

25
00:02:15,744 --> 00:02:20,160
years ago I think it's been a my stash but so long I only paid something

26
00:02:20,255 --> 00:02:24,927
like fifty be a pond for it I still got lades a bit left and yes

27
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:25,087
so

28
00:02:26,815 --> 00:02:30,464
I was hoping that I would be able to use up some mustache for this project

29
00:02:31,007 --> 00:02:37,664
and the main fabric this talk of gray I got this from a charity shop

30
00:02:38,815 --> 00:02:42,335
way more recently essentially I got the pattern

31
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:44,863
to test and then

32
00:02:46,143 --> 00:02:51,328
I found this fabric the following weekend in a nearby charity shop on the way home

33
00:02:51,423 --> 00:02:52,960
from a park run so that was

34
00:02:54,143 --> 00:03:00,000
really useful because I didn't have any fabric or enough fabric and my stash and what

35
00:03:00,063 --> 00:03:05,727
was required I'd say it it's a bit like a punter Roma it is a bit

36
00:03:06,175 --> 00:03:12,255
of a slightly different texture on the inside but I'm not sure it's really

37
00:03:14,207 --> 00:03:18,720
I don't think it really counts as sweatshirt fabric is not as thick as that they

38
00:03:18,815 --> 00:03:22,783
would say it's more like a medium wait plenty to be honest

39
00:03:23,807 --> 00:03:29,919
in terms of difficulty it's a really nice simple make him it's a loose fit so

40
00:03:29,951 --> 00:03:35,807
you don't really need to worry about fitting and it's what these lovely dropped shoulders so

41
00:03:36,479 --> 00:03:38,335
you don't have to certain the sleeves

42
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:45,695
and even having wise because I've gone with the option with the band

43
00:03:48,031 --> 00:03:54,240
it wasn't that difficult to attach I did try out the twin needle on this make

44
00:03:54,335 --> 00:03:59,104
so that's why it's kind of stretched a little bit and but it was a nice

45
00:03:59,199 --> 00:04:03,552
opportunity to try it with a stable fabric second see I've done it over on the

46
00:04:05,311 --> 00:04:11,007
neck line as well as the hem and on the cuffs so but

47
00:04:12,287 --> 00:04:13,184
they're to needle

48
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:18,528
it has the clerisy on the instructions but I can't say on the other views but

49
00:04:18,592 --> 00:04:24,351
the view I've done I found it really simple and straightforward to go through I did

50
00:04:24,447 --> 00:04:27,615
make a bit of an error on the neck band it turns out there is a

51
00:04:27,712 --> 00:04:32,992
particular way to at the neck band I was kind of used to I think I

52
00:04:33,119 --> 00:04:41,471
did another neckband quite soon before I made this one and on that one you essentially

53
00:04:41,984 --> 00:04:44,832
you joined up the short and so you have a little

54
00:04:46,015 --> 00:04:49,600
circle for your neck fans you folded it in half and then

55
00:04:50,976 --> 00:04:56,864
you pinned the quarters to attach it whereas this one did actually have notches and there

56
00:04:56,928 --> 00:05:01,343
is a particular way to attach it so on this pattern you can see that they've

57
00:05:01,567 --> 00:05:07,712
actually put the same for the neck brand on the left-hand side so it's a new

58
00:05:08,671 --> 00:05:12,032
showed the same where is done quite used to

59
00:05:13,343 --> 00:05:16,704
you be able to put the neckband wherever you want so typically I put it at

60
00:05:16,768 --> 00:05:22,015
the back and but on this occasion I did realize my error but that's more than

61
00:05:22,111 --> 00:05:26,368
I kind of caught a bit carried away it does actually saying the instructions so as

62
00:05:26,399 --> 00:05:26,783
long as you

63
00:05:28,063 --> 00:05:31,872
don't do what I didn't just go Oh I know what I'm doing now and then

64
00:05:31,967 --> 00:05:38,303
you should be able to notice that because otherwise it doesn't quite fit round properly so

65
00:05:38,368 --> 00:05:43,200
yet essentially it was all clear it's just you need to read through in terms of

66
00:05:43,231 --> 00:05:49,951
the fit I made a straight size ten I use their measurements as a guides and

67
00:05:50,239 --> 00:05:55,648
it fits fine it's designed to be at least but jumper so the wasn't anything I

68
00:05:55,776 --> 00:05:56,959
needed to change really

69
00:05:57,984 --> 00:06:01,760
I also am a big fan of loose fit items so

70
00:06:03,167 --> 00:06:08,959
yeah it's perfectly fine to me regarding the design it wasn't too sure when I first

71
00:06:09,631 --> 00:06:10,911
and finish this item

72
00:06:11,967 --> 00:06:17,343
I guess I don't wear an awful lot of jumpers so I wasn't too sure whether

73
00:06:17,696 --> 00:06:19,200
I firstly needed it

74
00:06:20,992 --> 00:06:25,664
and also I wasn't too sure about the him especially because I've done it in a

75
00:06:25,727 --> 00:06:30,847
contrast fabric I was a bit worried would look a bit to school jumpers that makes

76
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:35,648
sense and however I am really happy with it it's definitely grown on me

77
00:06:37,023 --> 00:06:40,256
and yeah I like having the cup sleeves

78
00:06:41,471 --> 00:06:45,376
I think if I made another one I would go for the final neck option next

79
00:06:45,471 --> 00:06:49,567
time just because I don't need tons of jumper's like this

80
00:06:50,623 --> 00:06:56,256
and it just looks really studly having the funnel neck time taken I can't really remember

81
00:06:56,320 --> 00:06:59,712
how long it took me but I'm pretty sure I got this done within a day

82
00:07:00,704 --> 00:07:05,696
as I mentioned it's quite a simple make there are a few pieces to cut if

83
00:07:05,791 --> 00:07:08,544
you do this view so you've got took up the sleeves

84
00:07:09,727 --> 00:07:11,424
and you've got to cut the cuffs

85
00:07:13,536 --> 00:07:14,528
you've got the

86
00:07:16,063 --> 00:07:16,480
the hem

87
00:07:17,760 --> 00:07:21,312
and then you've obviously got the main front and back pieces as well as the next

88
00:07:21,376 --> 00:07:28,575
band so there's a few more pieces then maybe a simpler pattern might have you know

89
00:07:28,928 --> 00:07:32,127
you could probably make a jumper out of four pieces with some

90
00:07:33,152 --> 00:07:34,048
designs that

91
00:07:35,488 --> 00:07:39,679
like I said and take too much longer to cut out and then after that you

92
00:07:39,743 --> 00:07:43,359
know I chose quite a stable fabric so it didn't take too long to

93
00:07:45,727 --> 00:07:49,567
to pinnate or and use the clothing but

94
00:07:50,783 --> 00:07:52,928
also their Pattersons designed with

95
00:07:54,048 --> 00:07:59,359
one sent me to see me I want so if you're using an overlocker it's you

96
00:07:59,648 --> 00:08:03,424
you know you haven't got is bigger seam allowance as you normally would see you won't

97
00:08:03,455 --> 00:08:06,880
have to why the catheter or you know stitch

98
00:08:08,032 --> 00:08:10,623
with the sewing machine to start with a then overlock so

99
00:08:11,648 --> 00:08:15,712
and that was quite a nice features you feel like you're using a bit less fabric

100
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:22,720
if you are going straight for the overlocker so to complete I'm really happy with this

101
00:08:22,847 --> 00:08:28,575
make it was a great experience it's the first time I've ever passed untested so it

102
00:08:28,608 --> 00:08:33,760
was definitely a nice one to start with as well because it it wasn't too complicated

103
00:08:34,111 --> 00:08:38,143
I felt like I could achieve it in the time that they specified

104
00:08:39,328 --> 00:08:43,840
and the only thing was it was really hot in the UK at the time so

105
00:08:44,736 --> 00:08:49,695
and it's only really just dropped in temperature now here so I haven't been able to

106
00:08:49,791 --> 00:08:54,495
wear it quite am a lot and you might notice I don't know if I've cropped

107
00:08:54,591 --> 00:09:00,671
my feet out of the photos but I am wearing sandals or flipflops just because it

108
00:09:00,703 --> 00:09:06,111
was so hot so I just quickly like threw on some jeggings and took some photos

109
00:09:06,911 --> 00:09:11,072
and then I had to quickly get out of it and get into shorts and a

110
00:09:11,168 --> 00:09:17,440
t-shirt because it was just so all the time but now it's a lot lot colder

111
00:09:18,208 --> 00:09:20,703
so I think it will be getting a lot of use now

112
00:09:22,495 --> 00:09:28,383
and you like I mentioned it's quite good value this person because you've got those different

113
00:09:28,447 --> 00:09:32,640
variations so I think you've got about four different ones

114
00:09:33,728 --> 00:09:38,591
one thing to note is that in the pattern testing stage they had a long in

115
00:09:38,656 --> 00:09:40,640
a cropped version for few a

116
00:09:42,015 --> 00:09:46,015
and now they've just kept the cropped version so I think

117
00:09:47,168 --> 00:09:53,888
the cropped version is about ten centimeters shorter than the version I've made so if you

118
00:09:53,984 --> 00:09:58,304
did want to make it as long as I have you would need to add that

119
00:09:58,367 --> 00:10:05,632
extra ten or eleven centimeters whether they're lengthened and shortened liners their means the long version

120
00:10:05,695 --> 00:10:09,888
that I made it kind of goes down so that's about my hip

121
00:10:11,072 --> 00:10:16,544
so it goes down to their so I mean the cropped version if it's ten sensory

122
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:17,408
stuff it probably

123
00:10:18,848 --> 00:10:22,143
would hit my hip a bit I quite like having a

124
00:10:23,424 --> 00:10:28,895
long jumper but they will we see if you did want to adapt the published pattern

125
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:33,664
what we need to do is add that extra ten or eleven centimeters where it says

126
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:36,895
length and all shorten on both your front and back pieces

127
00:10:38,656 --> 00:10:43,231
that's all I've really got to stay on it and so yet I'd recommend the pattern

128
00:10:43,455 --> 00:10:49,119
it's good value for money to get these different versions and I'll see you soon for

129
00:10:49,184 --> 00:10:51,296
another video thanks for watching
