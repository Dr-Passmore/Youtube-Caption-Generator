hello and welcome to my review of the fray address which is on the tailor's dummy

1
00:00:11,807 --> 00:00:17,663
next to me and the prey address is a pattern from the simply sewing magazine and

2
00:00:17,728 --> 00:00:21,951
it came out this year and it's a lovely pinnacle pattern

3
00:00:23,903 --> 00:00:28,832
it's got some great details on it which are listed on the front cover and for

4
00:00:28,895 --> 00:00:36,608
example it's got a bitted Buddhist and a line skirts patch pocket and topstitch detail

5
00:00:38,560 --> 00:00:43,456
the fabric I've used for this is from fabrics the law I got it as a

6
00:00:43,712 --> 00:00:45,984
knitting unstitching showed last September

7
00:00:47,231 --> 00:00:48,416
and it's lovely

8
00:00:49,568 --> 00:00:54,944
it's a lovely pattern however it does mean that it things to type so

9
00:00:56,287 --> 00:01:00,832
over see if you did want to wear in the winter it might be worth adding

10
00:01:01,408 --> 00:01:04,832
a slip or lining the skirt section

11
00:01:06,015 --> 00:01:11,232
I think if you made it in a plain fabric it would be a much easier

12
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:17,344
make because I had this happened fabric I had to take into account pattern matching the

13
00:01:17,407 --> 00:01:23,199
different sections such as the waist band to the bodiced and the waistband to the skirt

14
00:01:25,664 --> 00:01:29,087
see if you did it in a plain fabric you wouldn't have to worry about that

15
00:01:30,015 --> 00:01:36,704
apart from that I'd say it's a relatively simple make although there is a concessive which

16
00:01:36,767 --> 00:01:41,695
you need to insert and there's also button-holes to create

17
00:01:46,688 --> 00:01:51,776
bit of cards to the instructions I thought they were very clear and I did look

18
00:01:51,872 --> 00:01:52,031
up

19
00:01:53,087 --> 00:01:59,328
on a video to see how to insert the concealed ship just because I wanted to

20
00:01:59,487 --> 00:02:07,232
see and someone put one in themselves however there are in instructions within the directions for

21
00:02:07,295 --> 00:02:12,479
the pattern and they look like they were fine see what necessarily have to look up

22
00:02:12,576 --> 00:02:13,792
or videos like I did

23
00:02:15,615 --> 00:02:18,527
with the fit I didn't really adjust anything

24
00:02:19,647 --> 00:02:25,119
the only adjustments I made worth of the straps I've put them closer to the concealed

25
00:02:25,184 --> 00:02:30,432
step whereas in the pattern I think which was only a guide they suggested put it

26
00:02:30,527 --> 00:02:31,968
nearer to the bodice front

27
00:02:33,535 --> 00:02:34,399
I think also

28
00:02:36,095 --> 00:02:41,184
I've made them a bit shorter so the button holds a further up the straps

29
00:02:42,335 --> 00:02:47,615
the other alteration I made was I added an inch to the bottom of the skirt

30
00:02:47,904 --> 00:02:54,240
as I like to wear longer dresses and skirts and I didn't do a bigger him

31
00:02:55,552 --> 00:03:01,824
I really like the design of this pinafore I think the A-line skirt provides a really

32
00:03:01,919 --> 00:03:07,231
flattering look and also it only takes to me to the fabric if it had a

33
00:03:07,296 --> 00:03:10,367
circle skirts you consume a lot more fabric

34
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:16,703
I really like the fact it has patch pockets I'm not sure about patch pockets

35
00:03:18,496 --> 00:03:24,223
for this patent fabric as the meant that I had more pattern-matching issues

36
00:03:25,695 --> 00:03:30,111
it might have been better with insieme pockets but obviously if you made it in a

37
00:03:30,175 --> 00:03:33,119
plain fabric it would be a lovely decorative feature

38
00:03:34,783 --> 00:03:40,576
the other adjustment I did make was I got rid of the center seem on the

39
00:03:40,639 --> 00:03:45,087
skirts as this would have meant that I'd had to

40
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:48,511
taken into account the pattern matching again

41
00:03:49,632 --> 00:03:53,664
so I just took out the seam allowance in the center and cut it on the

42
00:03:53,759 --> 00:03:54,111
fold

43
00:03:55,455 --> 00:04:00,703
again if you made it in a plain fabric it would be another lovely decorative feature

44
00:04:02,175 --> 00:04:09,727
this project took me around twelve hours to complete and that's including cutting out the fabric

45
00:04:09,824 --> 00:04:10,496
at the beginning

46
00:04:11,583 --> 00:04:15,072
which I received took a bit of time as I haven't done a lot of or

47
00:04:15,199 --> 00:04:20,256
any had a matching before so I was being really careful to make sure that I

48
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:22,816
was cutting the pieces out accurately

49
00:04:24,768 --> 00:04:32,351
overall I think this is a fantastic project I highly recommend the patterns I can't really

50
00:04:32,447 --> 00:04:37,951
think of any false and in fact I want to make another one and I'm eyeing

51
00:04:38,048 --> 00:04:40,895
up some red denen capric once I can afford it
