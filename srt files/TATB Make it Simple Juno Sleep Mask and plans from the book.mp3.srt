hello I'm walking back to my channel as always if you like this video and like

1
00:00:03,263 --> 00:00:06,751
to see more please don't forget to like unsubscribe if you haven't already I just wanted

2
00:00:06,815 --> 00:00:09,600
to do a quick shout at the least a from and so on to thank her

3
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:14,911
for featuring my channel in one of her recent videos and she featured this channel along

4
00:00:15,232 --> 00:00:18,944
with I think it was about eleven others so if you do want to find some

5
00:00:19,007 --> 00:00:23,135
more sewing video channels to watch a deckman having a look at that the day so

6
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:27,775
it's gonna be a bit of a strange one today I'm basically it's been quite a

7
00:00:27,808 --> 00:00:31,104
long week which I can imagine I'm is the same for a lot of people at

8
00:00:31,135 --> 00:00:34,911
the moment I started a new drop on Monday and things have progressed quite a lot

9
00:00:35,136 --> 00:00:40,608
and in the UK our governments and finally filling in some measures to do with covert

10
00:00:40,639 --> 00:00:45,824
nineteen their very fortunate that in my new role I can't work from him the locks

11
00:00:45,855 --> 00:00:51,616
the past week has been trying to learn this of mining roll and the meanwhile everyone

12
00:00:52,223 --> 00:00:56,639
gradually dropping off as they started to work remotely it was always going to be a

13
00:00:56,768 --> 00:01:00,799
straight week started and you roll anyway but obviously and with what's going on at the

14
00:01:00,895 --> 00:01:06,431
moment it meant that immediately I had to make preparations to be able to work remotely

15
00:01:07,103 --> 00:01:11,040
and it's going to be interesting moving forward as I'm going to have to learn a

16
00:01:11,071 --> 00:01:16,000
new role remotely but I mean at least I can work as a result I don't

17
00:01:16,064 --> 00:01:20,639
get to get any sewing done during the week so I'm going to do a nice

18
00:01:20,736 --> 00:01:26,304
quick suffering project from the make it simple book I am going for the quickest one

19
00:01:26,367 --> 00:01:30,527
possible which is a do you know sleep mask so I

20
00:01:31,839 --> 00:01:33,760
got my templates already to go

21
00:01:34,912 --> 00:01:39,391
I've just found a scrap of fabric it literally at the scrap of fabric which I

22
00:01:39,648 --> 00:01:42,527
must have brought in a random bag at some point

23
00:01:44,064 --> 00:01:46,111
I've got and I spared for a lining

24
00:01:47,839 --> 00:01:48,863
and I've got

25
00:01:50,143 --> 00:01:57,183
a regular bit of elastic I don't have any nice judgy metallic elastic and such as

26
00:01:57,727 --> 00:02:01,856
isn't the one in the book but I'm not too fast but that I just want

27
00:02:01,888 --> 00:02:06,400
to make something which be nice quick and ossifying I've also got a bit of left

28
00:02:06,559 --> 00:02:09,087
over warding here to use to

29
00:02:10,143 --> 00:02:13,856
have some putting other mentioned in the birthday card again I thought would be interesting to

30
00:02:14,016 --> 00:02:18,591
compare my speed of sewing with the ones in the book so with the best card

31
00:02:18,656 --> 00:02:22,783
again I was quite a lot slower as this is a much quicker smoother project I

32
00:02:22,848 --> 00:02:27,520
don't expect the difference to be quite as big but I'm still interested to find out

33
00:02:27,583 --> 00:02:33,087
so operators very quick time lapse of me making the item and then I'm going to

34
00:02:33,888 --> 00:02:39,360
me one to just give an outline of the other makes I plan to make from

35
00:02:39,423 --> 00:02:42,720
this book because there are a few others I want to do again I'm going to

36
00:02:42,783 --> 00:02:46,527
look at comparing how long it takes me to make it versus the book that is

37
00:02:46,591 --> 00:02:50,527
if the variation I'm doing is one where the outlined a time when in the book

38
00:02:50,751 --> 00:02:54,783
will know when set myself of a time scale and went to complete all the makes

39
00:02:54,848 --> 00:03:00,544
from the book but it's just that forward-thinking things to look forward to well we spend

40
00:03:00,735 --> 00:03:04,095
a lot more time I right I'm going to get on with this now it's so

41
00:03:04,895 --> 00:03:09,055
let me see to get nearly twenty five past seven so just to give you a

42
00:03:09,087 --> 00:03:11,007
quick I do it all the timing's

43
00:03:12,255 --> 00:03:17,055
the I must so for casting climate has ten minutes and setting time for twenty five

44
00:03:17,087 --> 00:03:21,503
minutes so theoretically I should be done by eight o'clock right if I do

45
00:03:38,527 --> 00:03:42,688
okay so I've just cut out the pieces and that took me roughly five minutes so

46
00:03:43,231 --> 00:03:44,255
it's looking good so far

47
00:03:45,664 --> 00:03:48,671
okay so I'm gonna start going through the instructions

48
00:04:34,208 --> 00:04:38,463
thank you so that take me just over half an hour to make so on here

49
00:04:38,528 --> 00:04:43,295
I think it was twenty five in it gets too close by but it's so early

50
00:04:43,391 --> 00:04:47,967
took me an extra five minutes and it I saved the time by causing out quicker

51
00:04:48,096 --> 00:04:52,447
so it did only take me so to five in its in total which its great

52
00:04:53,088 --> 00:04:59,104
and I think needs a slight depressed so just thought I do a quick review so

53
00:04:59,424 --> 00:05:04,799
I'm obviously I am a fan of the cat shape so does say you could turn

54
00:05:04,864 --> 00:05:09,279
this into a uniform Seamus' if you want to do which is another good Ida I

55
00:05:09,407 --> 00:05:14,687
think I probably should use slightly think awarding this isn't very thick I don't think it'll

56
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:19,519
be a problem that society I think it was to be comfortable however it does seem

57
00:05:19,967 --> 00:05:24,640
like there's a lot of wiggle room sitting a bit back you so and it looks

58
00:05:24,704 --> 00:05:28,223
like you could put a thinker wanting in that if you want it it's one trying

59
00:05:28,287 --> 00:05:30,720
to day I do need to give it a little bit of practice to make it

60
00:05:30,752 --> 00:05:33,376
look a bit better but I think it

61
00:05:38,528 --> 00:05:44,511
only moved at a smidgen tighter than the pattern said however thing that I do have

62
00:05:44,608 --> 00:05:48,000
quite a large head so if you do have as many as you definitely need to

63
00:05:48,063 --> 00:05:53,152
adjust the elastic but from that it's a nice quicks that's why make and it's something

64
00:05:53,247 --> 00:05:59,743
that you could make for anyone reasonably easy and although obviously would be better if you

65
00:05:59,839 --> 00:06:05,055
knew how think that headed for the elastic I think you could make different sizes are

66
00:06:05,119 --> 00:06:10,752
you go to drink or enlarge this person template if you wanted to so you could

67
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:15,712
make one for a kid if you wanted to I'm sure that love a unicorn one

68
00:06:15,967 --> 00:06:20,480
so a rule I'm glad I make this it's nice to have done something sewing related

69
00:06:20,704 --> 00:06:27,007
after quite a long week so it's good to get back to the sewing machine and

70
00:06:27,391 --> 00:06:30,847
with this I don't really have to think too much oversee the only bit I really

71
00:06:30,911 --> 00:06:35,615
had to adapt was the elastic and that was pretty painless so the second part of

72
00:06:35,679 --> 00:06:40,992
my video is just my plans for the rest of the make it simple book so

73
00:06:41,247 --> 00:06:44,032
I have mentioned in I catch up previously but I wanted to make

74
00:06:45,055 --> 00:06:49,536
the majority of these patterns or at least the variation of each pattern so

75
00:06:50,687 --> 00:06:55,071
I've had to think since then about the materials that I want to use for this

76
00:06:55,359 --> 00:06:58,976
and I just thought I share that with you now they're hopefully I'll be able to

77
00:06:59,071 --> 00:07:03,584
make one in the next week so I can share a pattern review so the first

78
00:07:03,615 --> 00:07:09,279
person in the book is the Scythia trousers and I quite like to make the dungaree

79
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:16,640
version I'm not sure if I want to make the trouser virgin of them or Nick

80
00:07:16,864 --> 00:07:23,007
the shorts in the place it so I may possibly do that this is the fabric

81
00:07:23,135 --> 00:07:28,000
I intend to use it looks like it is an old person you thought I'd use

82
00:07:28,063 --> 00:07:32,895
this because it seems quite substantial but think it will still gather enough with the Thai

83
00:07:33,055 --> 00:07:37,855
that's on the dungarees and making I won't look too much like a curtain and I

84
00:07:37,984 --> 00:07:42,239
think what's going to help me decide whether to make the short all the trials of

85
00:07:42,272 --> 00:07:47,712
version is probably how much of it I've got here so I'm thinking probably the shortest

86
00:07:47,776 --> 00:07:53,503
Persian just out preference anyway because I think this fabric might look too much having too

87
00:07:53,536 --> 00:07:59,424
much of the fabric if that makes sense to the shorts might be a bit less

88
00:07:59,615 --> 00:08:02,911
in your facts anyway and also I think you look quite fun doing a short done

89
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:07,231
reversion so that for I find with that one I would love to you make this

90
00:08:07,328 --> 00:08:10,144
rock from places as well however and

91
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:16,415
essentially want to switch around the dungarees and the place it so for the playsuit out

92
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:21,376
quite like to the trousers on this one day for this happen I would like to

93
00:08:21,407 --> 00:08:28,735
use list fabric which is in my samish it's a nice it's got a bit great

94
00:08:29,696 --> 00:08:30,623
I'm assuming

95
00:08:32,064 --> 00:08:36,736
it's either a custom blend or its synthetic I feel like I got this from fabric

96
00:08:36,831 --> 00:08:41,952
land but it's been my social world which is why I can't guarantee the fabric content

97
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:48,096
but anyway I think it will look quite nice as a longer playsuits so if I

98
00:08:48,223 --> 00:08:52,320
do the trials of version and would probably be fairly suitable for work although saying suitable

99
00:08:52,383 --> 00:08:57,343
for work and works going to be at home for quite well now so friendly what

100
00:08:57,375 --> 00:09:02,528
will be comfortable to wear at him in the market home office now for the CQ

101
00:09:02,624 --> 00:09:06,719
dressed I think I'm going to make the short keep version I mentioned many times on

102
00:09:06,783 --> 00:09:10,911
this channel with that because I live in gone with quite mild so my preference is

103
00:09:11,007 --> 00:09:16,671
short to see stuff in general though I'm saying that wearing a long-sleeved tops today a

104
00:09:16,768 --> 00:09:22,271
pro manic in fact so I am shifted my preferences slightly but seeing as we are

105
00:09:22,624 --> 00:09:26,559
moving towards the summer I think it would be nice to make the secret rest of

106
00:09:26,624 --> 00:09:31,872
which has the sash and bent leaps so for this one I will make it out

107
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:37,056
of this fabric initially this is one that I got and I think it was a

108
00:09:37,567 --> 00:09:41,119
charity shop fabric I did over the summer just a nice it was a really nice

109
00:09:41,184 --> 00:09:45,280
soft material but I think it will be substantial enough we need to line up and

110
00:09:45,599 --> 00:09:48,895
would be nice to wear and some mentioned I've already done the birth kind again you

111
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:52,512
can see my past a review of this on the channel I may possibly make a

112
00:09:52,575 --> 00:09:56,768
second one and leads but it probably won't be for myself for the pajama lokshen I'm

113
00:09:56,799 --> 00:10:01,728
going to go for the shorty pj's rather than the original Juno pajamas again just because

114
00:10:01,791 --> 00:10:05,440
we get moving towards the summer and the gate and I really like the look of

115
00:10:05,536 --> 00:10:11,424
the shorts so this actually I may possibly make the longer version it is I do

116
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:12,031
have this

117
00:10:13,312 --> 00:10:18,880
chevron fabric which I think might be from Charlie better it's quite a nice design so

118
00:10:19,007 --> 00:10:23,328
it will we make the t-shirt in a plain white to go with it because I

119
00:10:23,424 --> 00:10:26,528
do have a little voice to my Satish and which is just from try to go

120
00:10:26,656 --> 00:10:31,072
locally so I do think this would look quite nice in the actual Juno pajamas that

121
00:10:31,231 --> 00:10:36,383
are longer seemed and longer like actual trousers or perhaps I will just go for the

122
00:10:36,575 --> 00:10:41,695
t-shirts of and make the trouser to John's the back of an option so I've just

123
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:46,943
make the sleepers and finally for the honor pinafore I've got a couple of options to

124
00:10:46,976 --> 00:10:52,607
this so I'm going to for the first time I'm going to make it out with

125
00:10:52,671 --> 00:11:01,471
this their color felt like sooting proper it's quite substantial and to say definitely synthetic an

126
00:11:01,567 --> 00:11:06,208
initial gut reaction it might be a blend but I think it's probably symplastic I just

127
00:11:06,239 --> 00:11:09,023
thought this would be quite good because it was

128
00:11:10,239 --> 00:11:13,695
probably hope the shape fairly well more I took it well anyway and I'm not sure

129
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:16,447
I'm gonna do that snap fasten it I might see if I can get some

130
00:11:17,823 --> 00:11:21,919
more appropriate that passes for this I do have some at home but there are like

131
00:11:22,015 --> 00:11:27,487
really bright multicolored ones where is this might benefit from having a you know being brought

132
00:11:28,479 --> 00:11:32,607
a little something like that and I have a brand in there are not sure brown

133
00:11:32,671 --> 00:11:36,479
might be suitable otherwise there are quite like to make it this initially I may then

134
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:40,096
make a more colorful one but I'd like to see what it looks like that and

135
00:11:40,127 --> 00:11:45,119
again this is one from my summer charity shop pool so at least I haven't spent

136
00:11:45,151 --> 00:11:48,192
too much on the fabric I can see how it goes and then if I really

137
00:11:48,255 --> 00:11:51,711
like pattern I can make it in something else but again this would be quite a

138
00:11:51,776 --> 00:11:54,528
good one for work and whenever

139
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:59,135
I go back to work the case that's my plans for the rest of the book

140
00:11:59,392 --> 00:12:08,288
so I'm wondering between making the olive pinnacle or the done berries first not sure which

141
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:11,455
one I'm going to go for yet but I'm hoping to do that within the next

142
00:12:11,552 --> 00:12:16,544
week I'm also happen to do a couple of quick tutorials and that you can make

143
00:12:16,736 --> 00:12:21,599
out the remnants in your homework so quickly they'll be up soon as well I'm forging
