today I'm revering the mickle stitch and save easy cotton and six for nine three at

1
00:00:10,623 --> 00:00:13,824
which consists of two market food which you can make

2
00:00:15,135 --> 00:00:22,048
I've made version a which is a more rectangular version it's got to wood and tells

3
00:00:22,143 --> 00:00:25,888
for the handles the cardboard banks and exterior pockets

4
00:00:27,775 --> 00:00:30,176
and this is the final result

5
00:00:32,032 --> 00:00:37,312
there as you can see of used their medium-weight cousin dark fabric for both the exterior

6
00:00:37,919 --> 00:00:39,263
and the interior lining

7
00:00:40,895 --> 00:00:47,551
of used interfacing as well and which is suggested as optional but I recommend it as

8
00:00:47,712 --> 00:00:50,048
even with the interfacing it's still

9
00:00:51,104 --> 00:00:55,807
not hold it structure very well although there's nothing in it so it would obviously hold

10
00:00:55,903 --> 00:00:58,175
better if I had a full of projects

11
00:00:59,776 --> 00:01:05,632
so the doubt I cut myself I'm using a sore I got a big piece of

12
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:07,583
wooden down from a local still

13
00:01:09,344 --> 00:01:13,472
and the base if I just take it out now and

14
00:01:14,688 --> 00:01:19,968
oversee it's covered in the fabric I really like this feature that it has a separate

15
00:01:20,031 --> 00:01:20,351
face

16
00:01:21,407 --> 00:01:27,680
and this is actually not cardboard as suggested on the pattern I've used the back of

17
00:01:28,288 --> 00:01:29,087
a picture frame

18
00:01:30,176 --> 00:01:35,744
so just a cheap picture frame which had a glass front the glass front has broken

19
00:01:35,935 --> 00:01:40,031
so this this was just a way of using up the rest of the frame

20
00:01:42,272 --> 00:01:44,288
with the edit has to saw that and spies

21
00:01:45,632 --> 00:01:51,519
in terms of difficulty I thought this was a my simple make its as its rectangular

22
00:01:52,896 --> 00:01:58,463
I thought Boucher with these the other design on this pattern but and this one lots

23
00:01:58,559 --> 00:02:03,008
of straight lines you have to tell at the corner but that's as complicated as it

24
00:02:03,136 --> 00:02:06,527
gets and this made it a nice easy made

25
00:02:07,807 --> 00:02:12,608
and the instructions very clear as well and they have the seam allowance printed on the

26
00:02:12,671 --> 00:02:19,360
patterns which was taking useful to me have matching its Styria pocket on both sides

27
00:02:21,759 --> 00:02:27,647
there all say lots of markers and options on the pattern to ensure this and you

28
00:02:27,776 --> 00:02:33,951
get the pocket lined up correctly and other aspects of the bag one thing I would

29
00:02:34,048 --> 00:02:41,119
highlighted it doesn't remind you to trim the seam allowance on the corner so and oversee

30
00:02:41,216 --> 00:02:47,199
this is a good idea to make sure that it's it neatly regarding the fit and

31
00:02:47,231 --> 00:02:52,608
design of this item I haven't used it myself as is a gift that I've made

32
00:02:53,727 --> 00:03:00,223
its intended use is to be an issue approach a bag it's a decent size of

33
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:04,895
not a similar missing croche about myself it's a little bit longer than this one

34
00:03:06,207 --> 00:03:11,455
however this one's wider probably always twice the width of the one my own so

35
00:03:12,671 --> 00:03:17,311
in terms of its capacity it's probably can hold a lot more

36
00:03:18,815 --> 00:03:23,104
however you would have to angle longer this needles to fit them in

37
00:03:24,192 --> 00:03:29,983
I really like the fact it's got exterior pocket I think these are great feature and

38
00:03:30,335 --> 00:03:35,488
extra storage I think that you could add the pocket to the inside as well it

39
00:03:35,552 --> 00:03:41,087
doesn't have advisor on that but it would be a very simple adjustment to make and

40
00:03:41,119 --> 00:03:42,880
then you've got extra sections

41
00:03:44,927 --> 00:03:50,240
and other key points to note is there's no fastening at the top so it's completely

42
00:03:50,432 --> 00:03:55,296
open an exposed and it depends what you're using it force if you are using it

43
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:59,167
as a market back and you may not wish to have a field

44
00:04:00,287 --> 00:04:05,408
and but if you are using it for traveling say and you may wish to add

45
00:04:05,503 --> 00:04:09,055
as it or even ties just to secure it a bit better

46
00:04:10,143 --> 00:04:16,992
another feature I wasn't too sure about was how they attach the wooden door handles in

47
00:04:17,055 --> 00:04:21,600
the pattern it suggests to glue them and I'm not very keen on the idea of

48
00:04:21,727 --> 00:04:26,783
adding loose I haven't done it myself which means they are moving around a bit and

49
00:04:26,816 --> 00:04:29,216
not even showed the blue would work that well anyway

50
00:04:30,368 --> 00:04:33,152
what I have done is I've added some hand-stitching

51
00:04:34,239 --> 00:04:39,328
just to secure it right up to the doubt the original machine stitching is right down

52
00:04:39,455 --> 00:04:44,832
here so I've just hand stitch I decide on the edge to ensure there is a

53
00:04:44,928 --> 00:04:48,608
bit more secure however on the design I've got

54
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:56,191
the the bag I've got that similar and they have actually soon the ends so that

55
00:04:56,287 --> 00:05:00,415
it can't come off the side and I think also the fabrics a bit they go

56
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:04,415
on each side so it's not even likely to pop up the other way

57
00:05:05,696 --> 00:05:10,303
is to seven and a half hours to make that's not including the time it took

58
00:05:10,432 --> 00:05:10,880
me to

59
00:05:11,967 --> 00:05:14,175
sort out the wooden doubt and the base

60
00:05:15,552 --> 00:05:20,608
it does include cutting time it probably took me half of that time half of the

61
00:05:20,671 --> 00:05:28,000
seven a half hours to cuts all the different pieces and attach the interfacing the rest

62
00:05:28,063 --> 00:05:31,424
of the time was for actually construction and sewing it up

63
00:05:32,447 --> 00:05:36,191
I would make this again it's a nice simple make I like a day they would

64
00:05:36,287 --> 00:05:42,944
be a few adjustments such as adding focus to the mining and perhaps adjusting Halys

65
00:05:44,096 --> 00:05:44,160
the

66
00:05:45,183 --> 00:05:50,079
wooden handles work portably shaving a bit of the length of the dales just the right

67
00:05:50,144 --> 00:05:56,351
and then so the edges down to secure the handle so they don't keep moving about

68
00:05:56,799 --> 00:06:03,424
and so I don't have to use blue-eyed also consider perhaps adding is it and for

69
00:06:03,488 --> 00:06:06,272
some other fast things just to make it a bit more secure as well
