hello today I'm sharing a time-lapse video of me making a birthday card with a dog

1
00:00:12,031 --> 00:00:12,288
on it

2
00:00:13,600 --> 00:00:17,600
so it's a bit some of the to one I've made recently I made a cat

3
00:00:17,663 --> 00:00:23,711
birthday card so this is essentially my dog variation so I've gone for a Jack Russell

4
00:00:23,936 --> 00:00:28,416
and this occasion just because the person who I've made it for has a Jack Russell

5
00:00:28,672 --> 00:00:34,240
at home in whether to create the design similar to what I did for the cat

6
00:00:34,335 --> 00:00:39,551
design I had a look on line at some real life pictures of Jack Russell's I

7
00:00:39,647 --> 00:00:44,448
think I actually found one of a Jack Russell who found a picture of a Jack

8
00:00:44,512 --> 00:00:48,992
Russell with a party horn in its mouth so that worked out pretty well to begin

9
00:00:49,088 --> 00:00:56,672
with I went around the whole of the outline of my design as before I mainly

10
00:00:56,799 --> 00:01:01,984
focused on creating an outline from the picture so I had a look at the picture

11
00:01:02,048 --> 00:01:07,744
then sketched out a rough outline that I could use for my design and noted any

12
00:01:07,839 --> 00:01:13,248
extra details on to add such as the face features the nose the eyes and but

13
00:01:13,311 --> 00:01:18,304
also obviously Jack Russell's have quite distinctive markings so I had a look at that as

14
00:01:18,431 --> 00:01:22,751
well I began by going around the whole of the outline I just find this a

15
00:01:22,847 --> 00:01:28,959
lot easier when I'm doing free machine embroidery and I've got the stitch length to zero

16
00:01:29,503 --> 00:01:35,263
and I'm just using a simple straight stitch I'm using a plain black threads just because

17
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:38,527
I want it to have a really strong outline

18
00:01:42,559 --> 00:01:48,064
once I got around the main details I then added some circles to the hat just

19
00:01:48,127 --> 00:01:50,015
for some extra detail

20
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:07,615
once I was done with the black threads I moved on to a brown color and

21
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:12,479
started to shade in so on this cards I did a bit more coloring him with

22
00:02:13,055 --> 00:02:17,792
pastilles last time but this time I want to do everything in the stitch I'm moving

23
00:02:18,048 --> 00:02:18,143
the

24
00:02:19,391 --> 00:02:23,776
fabric a bit quicker than before just because I want the shade I don't want it

25
00:02:23,807 --> 00:02:27,871
to be a solid bit of brown color I'm trying to make it a bit more

26
00:02:27,968 --> 00:02:34,048
shaded and looked like fair it's probably quite hardly in this recording but I'm stitching in

27
00:02:34,111 --> 00:02:39,104
a way that I believe the for would fall on on the dog if that makes

28
00:02:39,136 --> 00:02:39,391
sense

29
00:02:40,832 --> 00:02:41,824
and I'm adding a bit more

30
00:02:43,104 --> 00:02:49,951
stitching or closer range stitching on the edges of the is just that it's

31
00:02:51,136 --> 00:02:57,472
up that way it just adds a bit more shading and makes it look a bit

32
00:02:57,567 --> 00:03:02,272
more realistic not that actually think that looks like a real dog obviously looks like a

33
00:03:02,304 --> 00:03:02,688
cartoon

34
00:03:14,464 --> 00:03:19,296
for the posse hat I used a multicolored thread which I'd picked up when I found

35
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:22,880
some gutterman thread half price and hobby craft last year

36
00:03:38,399 --> 00:03:42,240
for the circles I decided to pick up an orange thread and I colored them all

37
00:03:42,335 --> 00:03:43,647
in in orange

38
00:03:58,751 --> 00:04:02,912
finish up with I colored the party horn in a blue color

39
00:04:17,503 --> 00:04:21,536
