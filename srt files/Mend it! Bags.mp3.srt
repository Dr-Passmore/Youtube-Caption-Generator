00:00:00,128 --> 00:00:03,808
hello today I'm doing some simple back mending as the ways if you like this video

1
00:00:03,967 --> 00:00:06,815
and want to see more please don't forget to life and subscribe if you haven't already

2
00:00:07,072 --> 00:00:12,512
so today I've got a couple of different repairs so the first one is this demon

3
00:00:12,607 --> 00:00:15,680
bag and that I made a while ago as you can see I've made it from

4
00:00:15,840 --> 00:00:19,743
an old pair of jeans just literally cut a bit below

5
00:00:21,087 --> 00:00:25,024
the top section ditch it together and yet just essentially

6
00:00:26,079 --> 00:00:30,368
him the bottom and I've used an old about that was broken just cut off a

7
00:00:30,431 --> 00:00:35,872
bit and added that just to gather around a bit and with some of the length

8
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,936
of the rest of the genes made a handle I can use this back the agents

9
00:00:40,256 --> 00:00:44,096
just because it has been damaged on an early to repair it it's not actually that

10
00:00:44,159 --> 00:00:49,951
bad I've only got this very small section to repair to know maybe two three inches

11
00:00:50,175 --> 00:00:53,664
and it's just where the hand-stitching has come away now one of the reasons it might

12
00:00:53,791 --> 00:00:59,040
keep breaking is because I'm using a vertical hemstitch I just looked at for the book

13
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:03,936
I didn't know that this particular Heming method was called fascicle hostage but they come it

14
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:09,024
might be there a different stitch would reinforce it a lot better however I'm going to

15
00:01:09,087 --> 00:01:12,543
stick the versicle hemstitch for now just because I like the finish you can't really see

16
00:01:12,608 --> 00:01:16,832
the stitches or they're not that obvious on the inside and I can't really stitch all

17
00:01:16,896 --> 00:01:21,120
the way through unless I want it to show although saying that the felt those hide

18
00:01:21,183 --> 00:01:26,335
up and I could potentially get the stitching close to the top stitching on the outside

19
00:01:26,431 --> 00:01:31,872
so actually saying that maybe in future I might repair it a different way but for

20
00:01:31,935 --> 00:01:35,552
this time I'm just going to do a simple versicle hemstitch the other one that I

21
00:01:35,648 --> 00:01:40,543
need to repair is a shot ball back it's these sea salt bags so I've got

22
00:01:40,575 --> 00:01:43,519
to you here but I can't actually see the problem with one of them I wasn't

23
00:01:43,552 --> 00:01:46,080
sure what the problem is would this one but then I saw that I'd put some

24
00:01:46,143 --> 00:01:50,143
closing clips to secure one of the handles here so I sent you were going to

25
00:01:50,176 --> 00:01:55,199
do on this one is machine stitch it back in place but I might also do

26
00:01:55,424 --> 00:02:00,991
a bit of overlocking because as you might notice if you've got one of these facts

27
00:02:01,024 --> 00:02:05,856
yourselves and it just praise so much because the back doesn't come overlocked

28
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:12,160
none of the seems a hand that they are turned over at the top but yes

29
00:02:12,544 --> 00:02:16,639
this sort of starts happening with these bags and I really get back there really useful

30
00:02:16,768 --> 00:02:22,048
their very substantial and it's a really thick waited fabric but it's completely fall apart quite

31
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:27,520
quickly because I think the stitches are quite wide and there's no overlooking in it so

32
00:02:27,679 --> 00:02:32,320
I'm going to begin with hand-stitching the bag that made I might trying to secure off

33
00:02:32,416 --> 00:02:36,927
the end that has fallen away so I sent that's just about enough

34
00:02:38,016 --> 00:02:38,527
of a niche here

35
00:02:41,856 --> 00:02:42,304
I'm just gonna

36
00:02:44,384 --> 00:02:45,184
go in and trying

37
00:02:46,815 --> 00:02:47,647
not to if I can

38
00:02:52,128 --> 00:02:54,912
just try and do the second time to reinforce it

39
00:02:58,559 --> 00:03:00,000
the original one should not take in

40
00:03:05,695 --> 00:03:06,240
just about

41
00:03:07,615 --> 00:03:11,231
red threaten from recent projects

42
00:03:12,895 --> 00:03:14,240
let's begin with I'm just going to

43
00:03:15,296 --> 00:03:20,416
cut a shortish length no longer than why I'm merely saying that I were quite alone

44
00:03:20,511 --> 00:03:20,735
said

45
00:03:22,815 --> 00:03:24,735
priedieu shorter just I'm

46
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:27,104
not in one and

47
00:03:30,751 --> 00:03:31,936
so just attached it so

48
00:03:33,119 --> 00:03:34,880
with vertical Hansard you

49
00:03:37,567 --> 00:03:43,839
starting from the fabric and you catch the top section and because this is really their

50
00:03:43,871 --> 00:03:48,192
promise I don't need to catch it to say but if you were having a garment

51
00:03:48,255 --> 00:03:49,664
and you don't want to to show the

52
00:03:50,912 --> 00:03:54,751
front side you are to just catch a bit of it so they won't show then

53
00:03:54,848 --> 00:03:55,679
I'm going along

54
00:03:57,824 --> 00:04:02,623
I'm going along the bits and go about down to the lining drawing it through then

55
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:03,552
going back up

56
00:04:04,671 --> 00:04:08,352
to the denim side and repeating so just

57
00:04:11,328 --> 00:04:15,423
then the and get this was a short little vertical stitch which I guess it's called

58
00:04:15,488 --> 00:04:20,511
vertical hand stitch and so it's just that tiny bit that's on display

59
00:04:22,144 --> 00:04:23,135
and the stitch

60
00:04:24,447 --> 00:04:26,559
the diagonal stitch down is hidden

61
00:04:28,032 --> 00:04:29,183
see it's just one of those

62
00:04:30,623 --> 00:04:35,648
tasks that I just haven't got round to and it is so simple really pretty gonna

63
00:04:35,712 --> 00:04:40,511
take me what ten minutes so as which she should realize how little it was to

64
00:04:40,575 --> 00:04:41,023
fix it

65
00:04:43,872 --> 00:04:46,656
for you just checked the rest of the bag in the second I'm just in case

66
00:04:47,231 --> 00:04:50,847
I have missed something else in case it was the reason you see I have got

67
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:52,608
away too much to enter to that section

68
00:04:54,335 --> 00:04:56,671
I'm pretty much done so what I'm gonna do is just sleep it

69
00:05:10,592 --> 00:05:14,368
all bad I've wasted that that perhaps I can use it something and just check around

70
00:05:14,399 --> 00:05:14,816
the rest

71
00:05:18,303 --> 00:05:22,432
but it turned out that that was a really quick sex so that's my first drop

72
00:05:22,528 --> 00:05:28,704
them ready to be used again okay so for fixing my sea-salt take backs I've just

73
00:05:28,735 --> 00:05:32,447
gone over to the sewing machine and the firstly I'm going to do is I'm going

74
00:05:32,511 --> 00:05:38,720
to remove any topstitching that's really close to the strap that I'm going to fix most

75
00:05:38,752 --> 00:05:42,048
of it has come away already and that's why it's not attached at the moment but

76
00:05:42,111 --> 00:05:45,760
there's the odd bit that might be slightly in my way for vexing and I'm just

77
00:05:45,791 --> 00:05:46,368
going to remove

78
00:05:48,063 --> 00:05:50,144
its only really a couple of stitches either and

79
00:05:54,847 --> 00:05:58,944
and what I'll do is all replace those later on so it's very simple I'm going

80
00:05:58,976 --> 00:06:00,351
to do here I'm just going to

81
00:06:02,175 --> 00:06:06,303
used a couple of quoting pegs to pay get into place which I think they've been

82
00:06:06,368 --> 00:06:06,592
over

83
00:06:08,063 --> 00:06:13,888
maybe I thought a convenient crease line already and where it's been folded before so I'm

84
00:06:13,951 --> 00:06:18,911
just lining that up with the group which marks the center and all my machine remain

85
00:06:18,976 --> 00:06:24,063
to keep them for input my sentence between to run through on my machine because it's

86
00:06:24,127 --> 00:06:28,320
quite a good material but I do want the stitches quite place together so that at

87
00:06:28,351 --> 00:06:32,480
last a bit longer them just being simple straight stitch from going to backtack at the

88
00:06:32,544 --> 00:06:37,312
front and end and I'm just going to go right over I replace the stitches that

89
00:06:37,343 --> 00:06:37,727
I'm missing

90
00:06:42,079 --> 00:06:43,584
so that's the handle back on

91
00:06:44,895 --> 00:06:46,015
check the other handles

92
00:06:47,135 --> 00:06:50,944
seem to be on okay I'm going to reading the topstitching next so I'm going to

93
00:06:50,976 --> 00:06:55,488
do it from the outside but I might just go around the whole bag I'll put

94
00:06:55,519 --> 00:06:56,160
it up to three

95
00:07:10,528 --> 00:07:15,839
they could be going round and doing the topstitching gun might extend the life of the

96
00:07:16,096 --> 00:07:16,256
other

97
00:07:17,407 --> 00:07:19,743
parts of the handle where it touches to the back

98
00:07:26,175 --> 00:07:30,496
make it last bit longer so what are probably do next is get my overlocker out

99
00:07:30,559 --> 00:07:34,816
and just overlook any ends I can I'm not going to undo any seems on that

100
00:07:34,944 --> 00:07:40,032
just to access the raw edges easier so as you can see because of the top

101
00:07:40,096 --> 00:07:41,567
stitching that isn't as much

102
00:07:43,167 --> 00:07:47,040
of an overlap here but I could probably still get the overlook around it to be

103
00:07:47,104 --> 00:07:50,239
honest to still enough of an end and then I will go to get right up

104
00:07:50,559 --> 00:07:54,847
into the corners with the overlocker but what I will be able to do it's just

105
00:07:54,911 --> 00:07:59,071
overlook them enough so that it's not fraying quite as much and I'll probably do that

106
00:07:59,135 --> 00:08:01,664
to the other Cecil bag of got here which I can't see

107
00:08:03,264 --> 00:08:06,783
where it's broken about from that I think it is literally this one's just spraying a

108
00:08:06,847 --> 00:08:12,320
lot more so that be the final thing I'll do and then my bag repairs for

109
00:08:12,384 --> 00:08:16,959
now L complete so for the overlooking the end I'm going to use my overlocker I've

110
00:08:17,055 --> 00:08:21,567
just changed machine but obviously could use an overlooking stitch on your sewing machine that would

111
00:08:21,631 --> 00:08:27,040
work just as well so I've just turned the bag inside out and I'm just going

112
00:08:27,167 --> 00:08:27,295
to

113
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:31,808
be around all the raw edges really that I can access for as far as I

114
00:08:31,903 --> 00:08:35,744
can access and that will just help it last longer you can see in this part

115
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:39,104
the stitching is really close to the rule air chair and that's just because so much

116
00:08:39,231 --> 00:08:43,168
of the fabric hands freight so it'll be good to secure this end it might just

117
00:08:43,231 --> 00:08:43,487
make it

118
00:08:54,271 --> 00:09:00,000
so found this top section the bit at the top is essentially almost like are facing

119
00:09:00,607 --> 00:09:01,791
on the inside of the bag

120
00:09:03,679 --> 00:09:09,599
at the top where the handles are as their sandwiched in between I found that this

121
00:09:09,695 --> 00:09:10,495
is a bit too

122
00:09:12,159 --> 00:09:16,607
tight the road him that I can see her so what I'm just gonna do is

123
00:09:16,671 --> 00:09:21,216
just trimming the really frayed edges but because there is that topstitched slides

124
00:09:22,559 --> 00:09:28,927
that should prevent it from completely disintegrating however obviously what you could do is you could

125
00:09:29,056 --> 00:09:30,367
unpick on the top stitching

126
00:09:31,679 --> 00:09:33,119
then overlock the ends

127
00:09:34,719 --> 00:09:38,080
that would be the best thing to do but see I don't really want to undo

128
00:09:38,176 --> 00:09:38,687
it too much

129
00:09:40,575 --> 00:09:43,263
I want to get it back in you as soon as possible but I think

130
00:09:45,312 --> 00:09:47,776
that will be enough overlocking on it anyway to

131
00:09:49,056 --> 00:09:50,271
get a lot of use out of that

132
00:09:52,416 --> 00:09:55,520
then perhaps when I do with a bit more time I can always come back to

133
00:09:55,616 --> 00:09:56,320
it and

134
00:09:58,783 --> 00:09:59,648
work on that section

135
00:10:01,504 --> 00:10:02,719
pretty happy with that

136
00:10:04,607 --> 00:10:05,216
is another end

137
00:10:10,208 --> 00:10:15,679
will be inside seems at the bag and now eval ox because the self don't do

138
00:10:15,744 --> 00:10:15,935
that

139
00:10:19,583 --> 00:10:21,056
one of them done I'm just going to

140
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:23,903
put the other one down here are just going to

141
00:10:27,296 --> 00:10:29,375
overlook the ends and this one as well

142
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:42,815
there we go the second season sorted out it's certainly worth overlooking those raw edges if

143
00:10:43,072 --> 00:10:46,752
you do have a bag like this where they haven't finished the marquis just means that

144
00:10:46,848 --> 00:10:51,616
those seems will hopefully be a bit more reenforced today you have it a couple of

145
00:10:51,648 --> 00:10:53,728
simple fragmenting options thanks for watching
