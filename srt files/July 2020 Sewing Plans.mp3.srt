00:00:00,479 --> 00:00:04,320
today I'm going to discuss my sewing plans for July as always if you like this

1
00:00:04,383 --> 00:00:08,064
video like Seymour please don't forget to lighten subscribe if you haven't already I don't normally

2
00:00:08,223 --> 00:00:13,184
do this sort of video which is quite a typical sewing blogger one mainly because I'm

3
00:00:13,279 --> 00:00:17,184
really bad at commencing to the plans I make so I'm very good at going yeah

4
00:00:17,312 --> 00:00:21,856
I want to create this and then I just don't get it achieved but especially within

5
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:25,184
a month however I had a change of heart recently and I thought why not give

6
00:00:25,247 --> 00:00:28,511
it a go for July as I have quite few things I'd really like to achieve

7
00:00:28,992 --> 00:00:34,880
I'm feeling a bit more motivated serving wise and I've picked some quite carefully planned makes

8
00:00:35,071 --> 00:00:40,383
which I'm hoping we'll get achieved due to the nature of them spoke the first one

9
00:00:40,416 --> 00:00:44,576
I want to share with you is that I'm looking at completing another of my twenty-twenty

10
00:00:44,672 --> 00:00:50,400
mate line makes which is the various Wester so I want to do the one with

11
00:00:50,431 --> 00:00:54,111
the marks neck line but I want it to be elbow life now originally I had

12
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:58,847
actually used the fabric eyeball Celeste it was the white fabric I used for my Juno

13
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:03,967
short pajamas I used that fabric for the t-shirt because I thought we were really well

14
00:01:04,031 --> 00:01:07,487
with that so I did end up using that fabric there is some of it left

15
00:01:07,552 --> 00:01:11,807
over I don't know if there is enough to make another talk maybe there's enough to

16
00:01:11,872 --> 00:01:16,639
make a patchwork top eventually but I can't find the remnants for the life of me

17
00:01:16,863 --> 00:01:21,248
I'm not sure where I'd visit so what I'm going to do is I'm going to

18
00:01:21,311 --> 00:01:26,751
use the remnant fabric that I used to make my journey dress reason in choosing this

19
00:01:26,816 --> 00:01:32,704
fabric is because it's got a decent amount stretching it it's quite solid it wasn't it

20
00:01:32,736 --> 00:01:33,311
doesn't I'm

21
00:01:35,008 --> 00:01:36,288
stretcher and losers

22
00:01:37,311 --> 00:01:42,272
color is that makes sense some subunit fabrics kind of go a bit faded if they

23
00:01:42,367 --> 00:01:46,111
get stretched too much because it is the next of keys in the Freya sweater I

24
00:01:46,272 --> 00:01:53,952
wouldn't want I'm but I'm color distortion to show when it was stretched so I think

25
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:56,319
I've got enough here I'm pretty confident I do

26
00:01:58,367 --> 00:02:03,744
so hopefully you can see where I cut it out Hey I'm hoping that this will

27
00:02:04,127 --> 00:02:09,472
turn into the talk because it will go nicely underneath and the upcycle denim to Oh

28
00:02:09,632 --> 00:02:14,272
I made the other years and it will probably go over

29
00:02:15,712 --> 00:02:18,880
from we go under a couple of other pantoufles I've got as well although it is

30
00:02:18,944 --> 00:02:23,007
a passant fabric I think it's on a nice simple design which will be quite versatile

31
00:02:23,199 --> 00:02:27,360
before I get round to my make line project for this month I'm probably going to

32
00:02:27,423 --> 00:02:29,472
finish off a different projects so

33
00:02:30,496 --> 00:02:37,343
I've mentioned this in different Instagram challenges before this is a very unbrokenly tried and tested

34
00:02:37,408 --> 00:02:42,912
passen of mine which is the mickles seven six seven five and its to make some

35
00:02:43,007 --> 00:02:47,360
shorts so I clearly got this at some point or someone has got it for me

36
00:02:47,712 --> 00:02:51,552
from a charity shop the pass inside is perfect for me I've made it before to

37
00:02:51,583 --> 00:02:58,464
make the drama shorts regulations and it turns out it I had already caught out this

38
00:02:58,527 --> 00:03:02,880
project so I think I got this out about two years I originally this fabric is

39
00:03:03,136 --> 00:03:07,807
from some pajama shorts to I made for my partner built and I thought I'd break

40
00:03:07,839 --> 00:03:09,759
myself a matching that and

41
00:03:11,296 --> 00:03:15,360
you can tell I got to the casting stage and never actually go around to finishing

42
00:03:15,423 --> 00:03:20,031
them up so this product is ultimately ready to go which is why I think it's

43
00:03:20,063 --> 00:03:23,264
really the first one I'm going to make this one I haven't caught out pockets yet

44
00:03:23,328 --> 00:03:27,423
actually but I might add some in team pockets just because it's always nice to have

45
00:03:27,455 --> 00:03:29,408
progress I freely went out the patch pockets

46
00:03:31,328 --> 00:03:35,167
but the grubbing will be there short shorts because I don't think I've got any more

47
00:03:35,199 --> 00:03:38,656
of this fabric kicking around to as the little

48
00:03:39,839 --> 00:03:43,583
extra bit of length on that so says fabric might have been really suitable to use

49
00:03:43,776 --> 00:03:48,479
with amber get it got stripes ever we could have done I go out UI I

50
00:03:48,576 --> 00:03:54,272
was there won't be quite the same effect because these aren't standard stripes and but I'm

51
00:03:54,335 --> 00:03:57,408
working with the remnants of caught hair and I must have cut this out two years

52
00:03:57,472 --> 00:04:00,671
ago and never around to it so I might do a pattern review of this one

53
00:04:00,735 --> 00:04:05,824
before ever mentioned I have made this passing up a few times I haven't done it

54
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:11,360
in at least unit but it would be good to document my false on it another

55
00:04:11,423 --> 00:04:16,384
plan of potentially got for July is to make a swimsuits now it's not that I

56
00:04:16,511 --> 00:04:21,119
particularly need one and obviously at the moment the pools aren't open around where we live

57
00:04:21,503 --> 00:04:24,768
I'm not sure if that in a change soon or whether will want to go and

58
00:04:24,832 --> 00:04:29,600
we do live right by a beach but because it's the ocean it it's freezing cold

59
00:04:29,727 --> 00:04:33,920
and I am probably more in trying to go into the sea in a wet sepal

60
00:04:34,239 --> 00:04:37,791
at least more and more covered up the one seat than the one I'm going to

61
00:04:37,824 --> 00:04:41,727
show you that the reason I want to make this is I do have some fabric

62
00:04:41,824 --> 00:04:45,343
which will bring me what for it and it is a pattern I've got in my

63
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:50,048
stash which looks quite straightforward to make to be honest now that I've got a bit

64
00:04:50,111 --> 00:04:56,160
more familiarity using stretch Roberts so it's in these style three three four six you can

65
00:04:56,256 --> 00:04:57,951
tell it's been so really take that

66
00:04:58,976 --> 00:05:04,415
time soon on greasy someone's I'm trying to look after it beforehand but it looks like

67
00:05:04,959 --> 00:05:08,287
I'm I must have got it from a tiny shop again for someone else got up

68
00:05:08,832 --> 00:05:12,735
on my behalf so yeah it is the begin in which I wouldn't say I'm a

69
00:05:12,799 --> 00:05:18,303
huge bikini van but it's quite like the designed so for Paul to neck talk it's

70
00:05:18,432 --> 00:05:23,903
elasticated at the back for the backstrap and what you do is there's a tie of

71
00:05:23,936 --> 00:05:28,415
the front so you just do it not at the front of the bikini top and

72
00:05:28,704 --> 00:05:34,111
even with the briefs its Scots and and last you you create case things for the

73
00:05:34,175 --> 00:05:40,160
elastic so you're not even stitching the elastic and having to be careful with gauging how

74
00:05:40,256 --> 00:05:45,279
much you stretch the but recall that you are literally just applying the past plastic and

75
00:05:45,376 --> 00:05:50,111
you are literally applying the elastic after you've done a casing and then ceiling it up

76
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:53,727
and securing it so I think that might be quite a fun project so the fabric

77
00:05:53,824 --> 00:05:54,272
of gods

78
00:05:55,424 --> 00:05:58,432
as she got when I did the course and it was them they were peering out

79
00:05:58,528 --> 00:06:03,584
there fabric supplies of stuff they weren't likely to use for the sort project they did

80
00:06:03,679 --> 00:06:07,808
that so it is this interesting for design I think it might be quite challenging to

81
00:06:07,872 --> 00:06:11,200
cut out but saying that I've got such a limited amount of it I'm just going

82
00:06:11,264 --> 00:06:17,055
to have to cut it and whichever way it fits on and which away the pass

83
00:06:17,119 --> 00:06:22,656
and pieces spit on the fabric so I'm pretty sure it's suitable swimmer that broke really

84
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:25,440
quite good at the gym's up as well I'm not sure if I will get around

85
00:06:25,471 --> 00:06:29,471
to this one but I've got it that ready and waiting and as I say it's

86
00:06:29,664 --> 00:06:33,152
fairly straightforward I think one of the most challenging parts will be coming the pieces out

87
00:06:33,183 --> 00:06:38,911
of the start moving on to some gift making so both of my niece's their birthdays

88
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:44,575
are coming up shortly so I want to get some get sorted for them so the

89
00:06:44,928 --> 00:06:51,040
first one is my younger nice and I'm just waiting for some measurements actually for my

90
00:06:51,167 --> 00:06:56,895
sister but I would quite like to make this a little romper dressed for them so

91
00:06:57,247 --> 00:07:01,600
I'd really like to give this after let go and but I do feel like because

92
00:07:01,664 --> 00:07:04,928
there is such as well window for them to merits I'm not sure whether it will

93
00:07:04,992 --> 00:07:09,664
be a suitable choice so well there would like to make I'm at this month I'm

94
00:07:09,696 --> 00:07:13,696
not sure I will and I was only to choose the fabric but I'm sure but

95
00:07:14,015 --> 00:07:18,463
something somewhere in my search but I'm gonna wait for the measurements first then about broad

96
00:07:18,528 --> 00:07:22,463
time I would and try to make that being on to my other nice and I

97
00:07:22,592 --> 00:07:28,959
did get our request to make a Unocal dress so I purchased this uniform and fabric

98
00:07:29,023 --> 00:07:31,872
from fabric land last time I visited so it's a

99
00:07:32,895 --> 00:07:38,015
simple cotton fabric but I thought that would fit the bill of the main request I

100
00:07:38,079 --> 00:07:42,976
got and because I want to show off the pattern I've come for quite a simple

101
00:07:43,071 --> 00:07:47,391
dress design I think possibly changed my mind on this but it is a really nice

102
00:07:47,776 --> 00:07:54,752
simple design pattern this is actually from prima and it as she comes with a lady's

103
00:07:54,783 --> 00:07:59,071
Dressel well I'm going for the girl dress which has showed a size at the top

104
00:07:59,135 --> 00:08:04,575
to essentially quiet front in fact attach it together create a casing at the top of

105
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:09,503
the front and back pieces and then you gather through I'm some fabric ribbons you make

106
00:08:10,111 --> 00:08:14,208
and you can reach out tie up the boats which will then fall on each stronger

107
00:08:14,368 --> 00:08:18,272
I think this would look quite nice and this fabric I mean possibly do the tides

108
00:08:18,335 --> 00:08:23,135
in a different fabric possibly even just white or I'll see what other fabrics I've got

109
00:08:23,488 --> 00:08:27,743
I'm hanging around at home but ye can I'll be quite a fun enjoyable simple make

110
00:08:28,608 --> 00:08:32,479
which who pollution appreciate I've already mentioned quite a lot of makes by this point and

111
00:08:32,512 --> 00:08:39,200
that's kind of my my core make goals for July and I'm not even expecting this

112
00:08:39,263 --> 00:08:42,304
as I really to finish all of that I'd like to get the gifts definitely done

113
00:08:42,432 --> 00:08:47,328
and I get the shorter pretty much a certain I'm else's the phrase I said and

114
00:08:47,455 --> 00:08:52,127
the swimsuits more of a bonus make but I do have two additional Poulos makes which

115
00:08:52,255 --> 00:08:55,776
I would like to make this one I'd like to make some more talks that can

116
00:08:55,807 --> 00:08:59,296
go on to the different killable as I have I'm sure of lots people who have

117
00:08:59,359 --> 00:09:03,104
jumped to the pinnacle bandor again and made all the doubly different plants to pentacles you

118
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:08,671
can in the sewing twenty will realize quite seen that use and lots find suitable talks

119
00:09:08,736 --> 00:09:13,119
to go underneath them so I'm going to rectify that I'm also using a fabric that

120
00:09:13,151 --> 00:09:18,656
I got from my last fabric land shop so I have these two tea shirting fabrics

121
00:09:18,848 --> 00:09:21,952
as this one here which I think you might still be up to get on the

122
00:09:22,047 --> 00:09:26,719
other landwards like and this one here so I think both of these will go quite

123
00:09:26,783 --> 00:09:31,583
nicely underneath the different pinafores I have one of them I quite like to make into

124
00:09:31,679 --> 00:09:37,119
another Frankie t-shirts and thinking possibly this yellow but I might drink my mind the other

125
00:09:37,184 --> 00:09:40,544
one I'd like to make into a tub of the teacher so I do have this

126
00:09:41,023 --> 00:09:47,583
white gripping fabric it doesn't quite match the them whites color on these consistence a bit

127
00:09:47,648 --> 00:09:51,424
more cream I'd say and but it's the closest thing that I have so which everyone

128
00:09:51,711 --> 00:09:56,831
says turning to the top of the t-shirts and will have this for the I'm going

129
00:09:56,864 --> 00:10:01,856
to do the version with the cuff bands so I'll do that and for the cups

130
00:10:02,304 --> 00:10:06,687
as well as the neckband so I was gonna say that's it for my plans makes

131
00:10:06,752 --> 00:10:10,880
but it's obviously quite a lot so that's what I'm hoping to achieve this month will

132
00:10:10,976 --> 00:10:12,447
see how much I actually get through

133
00:10:13,888 --> 00:10:17,791
I hope you enjoyed this and I'll see you next time thanks for watching
