00:00:00,800 --> 00:00:06,144
in today's video I'm going to going through using a sketch agraffes so I haven't actually

1
00:00:06,176 --> 00:00:11,232
used this properly before I think I got a couple of years ago after having a

2
00:00:11,328 --> 00:00:16,704
chat with my dad I was talking about and how in some Patton books you don't

3
00:00:17,856 --> 00:00:23,135
they don't give you the pattern pieces to scale and while it's okay to an extent

4
00:00:23,360 --> 00:00:28,672
for certain project to know you might be able to use a scholar or photocopier I'm

5
00:00:29,152 --> 00:00:33,472
at home or you might have someone locally I'm in your town that you can use

6
00:00:33,919 --> 00:00:35,200
this isn't always the case so

7
00:00:36,479 --> 00:00:40,159
anyway he mentioned this because he remembered it from when he was younger so

8
00:00:41,695 --> 00:00:47,487
so at one of these and I thought that my next project would be the perfect

9
00:00:47,551 --> 00:00:53,344
of gentes trys out I'm making the cozy bathtime penguin hair just make that people it

10
00:00:53,408 --> 00:00:56,223
involves there are too many passing pieces

11
00:00:57,504 --> 00:00:59,680
but in the back of the book you have to

12
00:01:01,951 --> 00:01:03,456
enlarge by two hundred percent

13
00:01:04,512 --> 00:01:09,152
and you've put the section at the top for the I'm eyes and there's an say

14
00:01:09,248 --> 00:01:13,984
the beak and then you've got the bath time penguin toy so you've got the body

15
00:01:14,272 --> 00:01:19,391
and then the detail on the front of the pink with so I'm gonna test out

16
00:01:19,456 --> 00:01:23,583
using the sketch graph to enlarge this by so Indra percent so on the sketcher up

17
00:01:24,319 --> 00:01:26,208
all of the instructions on the box on this one

18
00:01:28,223 --> 00:01:35,328
so you can either in large reduce or reproduce the original size because the pattern pieces

19
00:01:35,391 --> 00:01:40,832
were in the book and from the the diagram it looks like you need to have

20
00:01:40,863 --> 00:01:43,103
it on a flat surface I have actually traced cells

21
00:01:44,384 --> 00:01:51,328
the original design so I've got that to hand now the soul traceur onto an able

22
00:01:51,391 --> 00:01:51,839
newspaper

23
00:01:54,047 --> 00:01:58,751
the books to do that anymore and I've got a bit of a three paper to

24
00:01:58,879 --> 00:02:03,103
trace that one too so I've added a bit a blu-tack just add an extra bit

25
00:02:03,903 --> 00:02:05,279
do all the corners of

26
00:02:06,335 --> 00:02:10,207
the April peace paper just so it won't leave just going to check the position so

27
00:02:10,304 --> 00:02:16,352
too in large you have the original on the left-hand side and the peace Pieper you

28
00:02:16,384 --> 00:02:18,240
want to copy onto on the right-hand side so

29
00:02:20,416 --> 00:02:22,464
let's like it's on an angle but I don't know that matters

30
00:02:24,544 --> 00:02:27,167
were ship might put further out just so

31
00:02:28,895 --> 00:02:36,863
I'm not affected by I've got joined on the table here seston

32
00:02:38,688 --> 00:02:40,927
so this is the actual skeptical

33
00:02:42,175 --> 00:02:42,720
it's got

34
00:02:43,744 --> 00:02:45,248
to movable parts to it

35
00:02:46,304 --> 00:02:50,527
it's got this I'm it looks like a base I've added a bit about blu-tacked the

36
00:02:50,591 --> 00:02:54,335
bottom so that I can use it in a moment to stick it to the table

37
00:02:55,839 --> 00:02:57,184
there's also this point as well

38
00:02:59,136 --> 00:03:02,591
at one end so you've got a point to this end this some point dozen

39
00:03:03,679 --> 00:03:04,544
you can't remain that one

40
00:03:05,983 --> 00:03:07,104
but you also have

41
00:03:08,544 --> 00:03:12,128
these three white foam tears so they are emphasized so

42
00:03:13,472 --> 00:03:17,632
so this one's a this one's being in this Wednesday and depending on whether your enlarging

43
00:03:17,695 --> 00:03:21,343
reducing or reproducing you need to and put the

44
00:03:23,007 --> 00:03:27,615
the spike all the and flat face into one of these so

45
00:03:30,048 --> 00:03:33,983
okay this once called the pivot I think and it is called the guide pointer so

46
00:03:34,304 --> 00:03:36,639
you'll end up guiding it along the lines on your original

47
00:03:38,335 --> 00:03:42,272
if I put so many to put the pencil both in what

48
00:03:44,223 --> 00:03:48,352
just going to grab a pencil you say I'm going to try out a mechanical pencil

49
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:50,335
so the person needs to go in

50
00:03:52,384 --> 00:03:52,479
see

51
00:03:58,656 --> 00:04:00,544
the tracing pointer goes into

52
00:04:02,367 --> 00:04:03,968
the which is this middle one

53
00:04:06,304 --> 00:04:07,552
and the pivot in a

54
00:04:10,591 --> 00:04:14,751
so I'm just going to lose that over that and stick down

55
00:04:16,575 --> 00:04:17,279
piece of paper

56
00:04:20,928 --> 00:04:23,808
state now I need to put the pillar I might not left enough for that the

57
00:04:23,872 --> 00:04:24,096
side

58
00:04:31,264 --> 00:04:34,911
some just testing whether I can get this onto the peace paper

59
00:04:42,335 --> 00:04:44,895
whether there's enough for room so it's going to go off

60
00:04:45,951 --> 00:04:49,216
the peace paper about there so I don't know if I leave this

61
00:04:50,656 --> 00:04:51,328
long slightly

62
00:04:57,312 --> 00:05:00,544
can get it went to meet the table and

63
00:05:14,208 --> 00:05:17,503
I'm gonna stick it down there for now and then I should be a plucky at

64
00:05:17,567 --> 00:05:17,760
the two

65
00:05:18,911 --> 00:05:19,264
shapes

66
00:05:20,511 --> 00:05:22,656
on the left hand side and maybe the beach

67
00:05:24,096 --> 00:05:28,832
and then I might need to reposition when this is so in order to enlarge what

68
00:05:28,864 --> 00:05:30,752
you do it you hold on to the pencil

69
00:05:32,127 --> 00:05:36,575
but you focus on where the point is moving and you guys it around your shape

70
00:05:41,503 --> 00:05:42,079
run out of room

71
00:05:44,415 --> 00:05:45,760
after reading

72
00:05:47,104 --> 00:05:48,191
I didn't get this one of the

73
00:05:51,808 --> 00:05:53,951
but what it's a real test on your coordination

74
00:05:55,808 --> 00:05:58,015
okay so I admonished to trace out the

75
00:06:00,895 --> 00:06:03,167
body part of the toy it's a bit shaky

76
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:07,424
I thought I get its kind of test in your coordination and spit with colossally you're

77
00:06:07,488 --> 00:06:13,216
holding down the pencil but you're facing on points to be rather than see so a

78
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:15,071
little bit and challenging

79
00:06:17,216 --> 00:06:17,440
are you

80
00:06:25,536 --> 00:06:27,839
okay the second piece is not come out quite so well

81
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:31,552
actually the first attempt was better

82
00:06:32,768 --> 00:06:36,928
and that little wobbly line really wasn't much to worry about after trying to do the

83
00:06:37,055 --> 00:06:39,679
beak I didn't if it's just you far away from me here so

84
00:06:41,951 --> 00:06:42,496
maybe if I

85
00:06:43,712 --> 00:06:47,328
try again I might cut out the pieces so that I can get the peace paper

86
00:06:47,391 --> 00:06:52,223
a bit closer that way it's not stretching out too far and self really my next

87
00:06:52,351 --> 00:06:52,799
magic

88
00:06:54,432 --> 00:06:58,496
get some scissors with more paper and write

89
00:07:00,287 --> 00:07:03,903
some fairly happy his body peace second me that out when I cut out with that

90
00:07:03,967 --> 00:07:04,287
of these

91
00:07:22,496 --> 00:07:23,903
against the table wait for herbal

92
00:07:56,384 --> 00:08:00,415
go so costing the template into smaller pieces has really helped so

93
00:08:02,048 --> 00:08:07,679
we see having these two points closer together seem to in my experience anyway made it

94
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:09,376
a bit easier to you

95
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:15,040
okay so I'm going to carry on enlarging the other pieces for this template and so

96
00:08:15,391 --> 00:08:21,343
my initial thought there's a bit of an adjustment period to using the sketch raft it

97
00:08:21,407 --> 00:08:25,023
definitely is a useful tool but you have to have quite a study hand to

98
00:08:26,368 --> 00:08:32,255
I guess a steady hand and the coordination to carefully go over your template line and

99
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:37,664
so that it doesn't end up to wobbly on the other one you were making did

100
00:08:37,728 --> 00:08:41,791
I know how accurate it is I mean it looks barely actress

101
00:08:43,263 --> 00:08:45,280
and as you can say on the other

102
00:08:47,455 --> 00:08:53,440
when I did with the fake I got completely confused and I was quite wobbly going

103
00:08:53,632 --> 00:08:57,471
up on the curved line but it might because I was stretching quite far the tunnel

104
00:08:57,504 --> 00:09:01,471
by that point to definitely trying to keep it a bit plaisir and seemed to help

105
00:09:01,567 --> 00:09:08,575
with I'm controlling it and for me anyway so yes why useful tool to basic enlarging

106
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:10,304
and producing I don't know what the you can

107
00:09:11,487 --> 00:09:15,231
age the percentage I'm guessing it's just doubling it inside or I hope that this because

108
00:09:15,328 --> 00:09:16,351
I need us two hundred percent

109
00:09:17,567 --> 00:09:18,880
I don't know if you can move these

110
00:09:20,575 --> 00:09:23,648
is a talk so are other little points on that so I don't know whether you

111
00:09:23,711 --> 00:09:25,567
can make it you know

112
00:09:27,776 --> 00:09:30,687
your fifty percent or anything like only like fifty percent

113
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:36,351
okay they returned starting by enlarging the map such as a weapon from an

114
00:09:37,695 --> 00:09:39,616
and I'd say this is a much simpler

115
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:45,888
starting point antheia there really are obviously it's a lot greater just I'm going to a

116
00:09:45,952 --> 00:09:49,856
vertical be a bit as scapegraces an option of you if you want to be around

117
00:09:50,143 --> 00:09:52,512
with that I think that make Austin all four up so

118
00:09:53,664 --> 00:09:56,671
you know and obviously then you don't have to go out and pay the cost for

119
00:09:56,799 --> 00:10:00,736
it and it's just the goods you have in your own resources you know using some

120
00:10:00,799 --> 00:10:05,151
you'll paper and pencil and but yeah I mean it seems right I think you'd get

121
00:10:05,216 --> 00:10:07,231
better as a adat as you went along so

122
00:10:08,799 --> 00:10:13,888
yeah that's pretty much my assessment of the skeptical and I receive you've had during experience

123
00:10:13,952 --> 00:10:17,184
with the sketch grand were locked and Erica got any tips for advice on using hat

124
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:21,984
that our boys yeah all my steps are just try and cut out your

125
00:10:23,455 --> 00:10:28,607
your original as smooth as possible so that you can then get your peace pick that

126
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:33,504
you're tracing on to them as face as possible and hear it just think it's a

127
00:10:33,536 --> 00:10:34,719
matter of practice really funny

128
00:10:36,192 --> 00:10:38,239
and that's the first today and fact for watching
