hello today I'm sharing you a time-lapse of a guitar card I made for my dad

1
00:00:12,031 --> 00:00:17,983
and my dubs very and to music and I thought he had appreciate this so to

2
00:00:18,079 --> 00:00:23,711
start with I had a quick search online to find the outline of a guitar as

3
00:00:23,808 --> 00:00:24,544
I wanted to

4
00:00:25,728 --> 00:00:27,936
make it I just wanted the silhouette

5
00:00:29,503 --> 00:00:34,911
say once I found one on my phone I then drew out roughly how big the

6
00:00:35,007 --> 00:00:39,104
card was going to be and as I had some card templates at home

7
00:00:40,192 --> 00:00:47,583
then sketched out the guitar outline that found online will they obviously you could print it

8
00:00:47,616 --> 00:00:53,408
out and then draw around it and to save yourself sketching us out and I come

9
00:00:53,472 --> 00:00:56,832
of people that to do that so once I have done the rough outline I just

10
00:00:56,895 --> 00:01:01,023
need in the top of it as I broccoli sketched it to start with and then

11
00:01:01,408 --> 00:01:03,263
made their lines a bit more prominent

12
00:01:04,543 --> 00:01:10,239
then choose an embroidery hoop I was using machine embroidery for this when you use the

13
00:01:10,304 --> 00:01:15,552
hoop you need to make sure the fabrics really thought this a that this it stitches

14
00:01:15,744 --> 00:01:20,543
through really well once I've done that I got a fabric pen because the fabric outside

15
00:01:20,671 --> 00:01:25,440
to used and was light enough I could trace through easily from the piece of paper

16
00:01:26,111 --> 00:01:30,015
once I had the outline and drawn on to my fabric I then moved on to

17
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:30,944
the sewing machine

18
00:01:32,127 --> 00:01:33,536
so to start with I

19
00:01:34,559 --> 00:01:40,031
went around the whole of the outline a few times to really get that section to

20
00:01:40,127 --> 00:01:40,832
stand out

21
00:01:42,367 --> 00:01:47,648
you can see that I decided to use a multicolored thread and this is a Christman

22
00:01:47,776 --> 00:01:53,727
thread I just thought and as I was keeping the design fairly simple it would highlight

23
00:01:53,952 --> 00:01:55,935
and this lovely choice of third

24
00:02:22,591 --> 00:02:28,384
one both been through the outline I then decided to change to a different stitch

25
00:02:29,408 --> 00:02:36,128
I decide to look at some of the extra fancy stitches on my sewing machine so

26
00:02:36,255 --> 00:02:37,055
you can see of use

27
00:02:38,815 --> 00:02:44,160
one of the exact stitches there and with free machine embroidery sometimes they don't come out

28
00:02:44,223 --> 00:02:51,583
brilliantly but it again it's just about how fast you move the fabric under the needle

29
00:02:51,839 --> 00:02:52,160
and

30
00:02:53,184 --> 00:02:57,055
which way around you decide to guide it as well so and you can get some

31
00:02:57,119 --> 00:03:04,000
really nice events there I was just experimenting here essentially so I went around different ways

32
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:08,063
I think in the end I found my preferred stitch to use

33
00:03:09,119 --> 00:03:12,832
and stuck with that for the most part but I have experimented with a few of

34
00:03:12,895 --> 00:03:14,048
the decorative stitches

35
00:03:30,175 --> 00:03:36,255
once I finished that I cut off all the least threats and then taken out of

36
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:40,384
dean broidery who I did say you press it with a lion which you can see

37
00:03:40,479 --> 00:03:40,927
on the video

38
00:03:42,335 --> 00:03:43,744
now the way that I stick

39
00:03:44,832 --> 00:03:51,039
machine embroidery on to card templates as I use double-sided tape and list so things that

40
00:03:51,072 --> 00:03:55,807
you could take it off the card if you want to do after using it as

41
00:03:55,904 --> 00:03:56,255
a card

42
00:03:57,759 --> 00:04:03,104
so I just roughly and draw the tape along and Custer as you can always hold

43
00:04:03,583 --> 00:04:07,904
double-sided tape in on its don't fit still going to stick and yeah I just cover

44
00:04:07,968 --> 00:04:13,472
the whole of the front surface that the meeting sticks on really well

45
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:17,119
let's find it quite hard placing

46
00:04:18,528 --> 00:04:19,615
their design on to

47
00:04:20,735 --> 00:04:27,071
onto the piece of cards so you can see here I'm trying to measure a sacculus

48
00:04:27,135 --> 00:04:31,391
Lee so that I can get it century on to the best of part we see

49
00:04:31,488 --> 00:04:37,023
this bells rely on your card being very accurate and Lucy

50
00:04:38,272 --> 00:04:43,743
during measurements being accurate you can see here I wasn't happy with the original alignment

51
00:04:44,895 --> 00:04:48,928
but you can just take it up again and then I replied it

52
00:04:50,015 --> 00:04:55,264
double check for measurements one so happy with it I then pressed it on firmer

53
00:04:56,768 --> 00:04:58,079
then need my rotary cutter

54
00:04:59,295 --> 00:05:00,768
neatly around the edges

55
00:05:02,687 --> 00:05:04,928
give it another press down and that's pretty much it
