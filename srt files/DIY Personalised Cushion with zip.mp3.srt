00:00:00,575 --> 00:00:03,391
hello you today I'm going to show you how to make this question

1
00:00:04,768 --> 00:00:07,935
if you do at this video I'm about to see more content please don't forget to

2
00:00:08,095 --> 00:00:13,727
like and subscribe if you haven't already okay so basically I'm making a cushion because someone

3
00:00:13,791 --> 00:00:17,375
I know that birthdays coming up and I got this would be a nice gift to

4
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:21,823
make them having an awful lot of time to make it so that the other is

5
00:00:21,856 --> 00:00:25,663
an awful for a vision but I think I'm it won't take too long it's like

6
00:00:26,079 --> 00:00:30,944
that normally I make an envelope fold when I do a kitchen so that's when it's

7
00:00:31,040 --> 00:00:35,807
caught and you don't use to to for anything or any other fastenings and you have

8
00:00:35,872 --> 00:00:41,119
one long better of fabric before one bit over at the other side overlaps so that

9
00:00:41,183 --> 00:00:44,928
if you do need to push him pads you want opening at the back the only

10
00:00:45,023 --> 00:00:49,472
drawback to that is you don't really have a proper back if I just am get

11
00:00:49,504 --> 00:00:55,296
an example so here is an example of an envelopes volte cushion which I've made previously

12
00:00:55,936 --> 00:01:00,799
so as you can see on the back the to therapy back pieces and the overlap

13
00:01:01,312 --> 00:01:03,967
so all day the kitchen had isn't on show you can get it out if you

14
00:01:04,064 --> 00:01:08,192
did want to wash the cover not actually sure why I did this one with any

15
00:01:08,288 --> 00:01:10,944
opening because it is probably quite difficult to watch

16
00:01:12,192 --> 00:01:16,480
any apparently I thought the option so obviously the advantage of do in the envelope old

17
00:01:16,575 --> 00:01:20,543
style is that you do don't lead as it but why do the sit version the

18
00:01:20,639 --> 00:01:25,664
reason I'm doing the that version is because I had really limited fabric for the back

19
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:29,440
peace I wanted to use a playing white for the front because I'm going to do

20
00:01:29,503 --> 00:01:33,856
a bit of three machine embroidery on it but the back I wanted to have I'm

21
00:01:34,015 --> 00:01:41,664
a color background so going for this great which is lovely but I use this for

22
00:01:42,208 --> 00:01:45,919
three aprons last Christmas and it means that I haven't gone and pull off and left

23
00:01:46,047 --> 00:01:50,879
so I just about had enough to cut this square of fabric so as I mentioned

24
00:01:51,008 --> 00:01:55,167
I've got a plain front I get this is reached out go to be assessed and

25
00:01:55,263 --> 00:01:57,503
the design I'm going to be using

26
00:01:58,688 --> 00:02:03,807
is on a circulant Funt because I believe she likes button-front so break down of what

27
00:02:03,872 --> 00:02:09,087
you need if you do want to follow along so I cut out two squares the

28
00:02:09,472 --> 00:02:13,216
a break for the front and the back of the cushion in their colors that I

29
00:02:13,279 --> 00:02:19,199
wanted they for less this is forty two centimeters by forty two centimeters the reason I've

30
00:02:19,488 --> 00:02:25,311
done it the shape is because my kishen pads is for to two centimeters although it

31
00:02:25,376 --> 00:02:30,432
is for two centimeters by forty to and I've got out peace which is exactly the

32
00:02:30,496 --> 00:02:36,223
right measurement this is actually factoring in a one centimeter seam allowance all way around because

33
00:02:36,287 --> 00:02:40,768
I actually want the cushion paths to end up faulty centimeters this is just because I

34
00:02:40,927 --> 00:02:48,223
think it's nice time or really from mastication so and by not giving a lot of

35
00:02:48,895 --> 00:02:53,055
wiggle room it will mean that it's I'm a nice competition so yet obviously if you

36
00:02:53,119 --> 00:02:56,608
do want to make a different size cushion just major your cushion pads depending on how

37
00:02:57,055 --> 00:03:02,272
plump your petition pattern you pay once you as a seam allowance on top of that

38
00:03:02,335 --> 00:03:06,207
measurement rather than doing more I did so in that case you just need to add

39
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:11,104
whatever you prefer is your seam allowance but to lots of that one so one on

40
00:03:11,199 --> 00:03:15,423
each side and then do the same for the to the length as well it case

41
00:03:15,455 --> 00:03:19,104
to do the two main pieces of fabric eyeballs they got a scrap because I'm going

42
00:03:19,167 --> 00:03:20,128
to do a bit of PK

43
00:03:21,184 --> 00:03:26,111
on it and it's going to be the pot section of my design so what I've

44
00:03:26,175 --> 00:03:32,063
done to create this template is just I've drawn loosely around the outside of the pop

45
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:37,824
because what I'll do is are free machine stitch the line which will just be inside

46
00:03:38,048 --> 00:03:41,216
the applicator of fabric I'm going to as you ever see if you want to add

47
00:03:41,248 --> 00:03:45,759
a with a decoration you need your design and then I've also got some different threats

48
00:03:45,856 --> 00:03:49,983
to you so I'm probably going to use black to draw out the the parts of

49
00:03:50,016 --> 00:03:53,759
the bottom I'm not sure whether are gonna black or just go straight on to the

50
00:03:53,919 --> 00:03:57,343
shapes of green for the leaves I'll have to think about it when I get there

51
00:03:57,503 --> 00:04:02,080
I would obviously you need the step as well so I've chosen one that's and this

52
00:04:02,111 --> 00:04:07,488
was actually quite long it's forty Paul's centimeters so um it's more than enough so you

53
00:04:07,552 --> 00:04:10,111
just need to choose one that's essentially the

54
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:15,104
length of one of your site's to ensure that you've got enough that I will say

55
00:04:15,199 --> 00:04:18,944
go out a magic pans hand so I use this when I want to be a

56
00:04:18,976 --> 00:04:22,335
bit more accurate with my free machine umbral treat design I'm also going to use a

57
00:04:22,432 --> 00:04:28,287
bit of wonder whether to stick the plant parts section a cases to begin with I'm

58
00:04:28,351 --> 00:04:33,920
going to overlook all of the edges on my front peace and my back these I'm

59
00:04:33,984 --> 00:04:36,832
just doing this now just to get it over with no really I just which the

60
00:04:36,895 --> 00:04:39,872
scene and then overlocked but because I'm heading as it I don't want to forget to

61
00:04:39,936 --> 00:04:44,959
do it and put the second first so that's Mephisto obviously if you don't have an

62
00:04:45,055 --> 00:04:49,471
overlocker you can just use the overlooking thing on your phone machine and do this exact

63
00:04:49,503 --> 00:04:53,760
stitch or depending how much your fabric phrase you might envy of tissues pinking shears

64
00:04:54,911 --> 00:04:55,967
but as I do want this to

65
00:04:57,343 --> 00:05:01,920
be able to withstand the washing machine if they do to slide to watch us every

66
00:05:02,015 --> 00:05:07,135
soften and I just think that it was locking it will help it lasts longer

67
00:05:27,712 --> 00:05:29,376
I'm not going to get a move on to

68
00:05:31,104 --> 00:05:33,088
creating the design I'm going to

69
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:35,584
trace my

70
00:05:37,119 --> 00:05:38,496
aunt part on to bundle

71
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:54,463
my wonderworks quite a bold to them to the sticky there and the paper layer coming

72
00:05:54,496 --> 00:05:55,391
away from each other so

73
00:05:56,704 --> 00:06:00,351
it is something to I remind the Fuehrer make use of soup on the one of

74
00:06:00,415 --> 00:06:02,368
the seven to be extra careful that

75
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,720
I'm calling on to both players that they cut together

76
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:15,488
next I'm going to attach

77
00:06:16,832 --> 00:06:21,536
my shape to my brain fabric the Emeka that I thought

78
00:06:35,424 --> 00:06:40,704
they want you all that fact there were busy make sure the sticky size is against

79
00:06:40,735 --> 00:06:45,088
the fabric and your whining on the paper peace and you can cut the ants

80
00:06:47,839 --> 00:06:48,640
so discussing

81
00:06:52,063 --> 00:06:56,768
just rollings actually you don't have to the great exactly the shape my clients on only

82
00:06:56,864 --> 00:06:59,328
I actually just caught it loosely for the first day to them

83
00:07:00,928 --> 00:07:06,079
wants this find on I then prefers to duty to that it's done I'm just

84
00:07:07,328 --> 00:07:09,727
going to take off the paper

85
00:07:11,104 --> 00:07:14,847
acting now just because I've done it before where I have

86
00:07:15,936 --> 00:07:19,776
touched I have to position it will campily and then I realized on the paper and

87
00:07:19,839 --> 00:07:24,704
hand me that so the next step is working out where you want your meeting so

88
00:07:28,032 --> 00:07:31,104
for this one what I'm going to do that I'm going to work out roughly with

89
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:31,552
middlers

90
00:07:37,088 --> 00:07:40,704
I'm doing that just by wanting in the heart down folding it and heart again

91
00:07:42,528 --> 00:07:45,503
I know that's roughly adult my just

92
00:07:47,872 --> 00:07:48,447
magic in

93
00:07:54,303 --> 00:07:57,600
there we go so I can see my metal that the fork out what the middle

94
00:07:57,664 --> 00:07:58,111
is on this

95
00:08:09,824 --> 00:08:11,743
scene it doesn't need to be exact so just

96
00:08:13,343 --> 00:08:13,855
it's pretty

97
00:08:20,928 --> 00:08:21,247
much the

98
00:08:24,895 --> 00:08:27,903
same so when confirming happy with the positioning

99
00:08:31,104 --> 00:08:31,519
going to

100
00:08:35,168 --> 00:08:35,935
this section

101
00:08:37,088 --> 00:08:39,840
and I'm just going to iron this on first because

102
00:08:40,927 --> 00:08:45,440
don't want to eye in the fabric pen design on their or it may become permanent

103
00:08:49,312 --> 00:08:51,007
right now I'm going to draw the

104
00:08:52,127 --> 00:08:53,728
lines that they want to fall for the

105
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:55,807
free-motion design

106
00:09:07,903 --> 00:09:11,807
case with my design thrown out I'm going to go into the machine now if you

107
00:09:11,872 --> 00:09:16,447
do want to make a similar design basically what I did to find that the

108
00:09:17,567 --> 00:09:20,768
design I wanted it was I just had a quick look on lines the research to

109
00:09:20,831 --> 00:09:28,096
succulence found an image of a succulent eyelight and then just use that to Roman version

110
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:26,591
that

111
00:10:55,711 --> 00:11:00,703
case now but the design on the front allocation smutted out I'm going to move on

112
00:11:00,799 --> 00:11:05,216
to attaching the zip so I want my debt to be at the bottom of the

113
00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:06,591
cushion so I'm going to

114
00:11:07,648 --> 00:11:13,728
move out over to one side and then placing my backpiece on top of the front

115
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:14,015
peace

116
00:11:15,903 --> 00:11:16,447
they line up

117
00:11:17,695 --> 00:11:20,864
next I'm going to mark for centimeters

118
00:11:21,888 --> 00:11:26,880
from either edge of the side that I'm fisting the zip on the reason for this

119
00:11:26,976 --> 00:11:30,463
is just the that there's a bit of the border on either side so the whole

120
00:11:30,624 --> 00:11:32,575
edge isn't completely separate make sense

121
00:11:33,888 --> 00:11:38,239
so just marked that with the magic pen and then I'm just a few clips and

122
00:11:38,304 --> 00:11:41,888
so that it stays in places I never hope to the machine so I'll just do

123
00:11:41,984 --> 00:11:45,056
a straight stitch over the for sense to me to the

124
00:11:46,143 --> 00:11:47,711
top and and the bottle and

125
00:11:53,536 --> 00:11:56,255
so now it's such a one of those two ends are going to the ward back

126
00:12:02,943 --> 00:12:06,559
with one side pressed out I'm going to put the it

127
00:12:07,968 --> 00:12:08,671
right side down

128
00:12:16,831 --> 00:12:36,192
just grabbed a few Hennessey Atmore pins if you want so now I'm going to stitch

129
00:12:37,280 --> 00:12:38,367
that side of the simple

130
00:12:39,583 --> 00:12:40,864
for this I need the zipper for

131
00:12:50,943 --> 00:12:53,664
someone pointed the tips detached so Merricks finally to

132
00:12:54,752 --> 00:12:56,031
attach the other side

133
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:33,728
in place

134
00:13:35,776 --> 00:13:44,159
I'm not going to talk it's the final step is to go around so

135
00:13:50,815 --> 00:13:55,168
but yes not just going to now finish the seams of the other three sites and

136
00:13:55,231 --> 00:13:55,648
epically

137
00:13:57,471 --> 00:14:23,903
we should have additional of that you might need to trim the corn and desolate from

138
00:14:23,968 --> 00:14:27,231
out nicely I'm just gonna check how it is another thing to note its to make

139
00:14:27,263 --> 00:14:29,056
sure you have your lip open

140
00:14:30,239 --> 00:14:33,216
so that you can turn out right side out and which is what I thought to

141
00:14:33,247 --> 00:14:33,343
do

142
00:14:38,271 --> 00:14:41,536
you think I'm going to also trees that they thought now as well

143
00:14:56,768 --> 00:15:01,664
okay so that you have it as the cushion so as you can see it's not

144
00:15:01,728 --> 00:15:07,744
too difficult to add as it I'm just depending how much your Perikles and why he

145
00:15:07,807 --> 00:15:12,960
gets up it's just cheaper to do number like food rather than as it one bit

146
00:15:13,216 --> 00:15:17,536
and it doesn't use less fabric and also means that you could have done the double

147
00:15:17,599 --> 00:15:21,888
design Seeckt at something on the back of well obviously I didn't in this instance but

148
00:15:21,952 --> 00:15:27,104
I oversee has a much clean of finish not having that you don't need a contrastive

149
00:15:27,231 --> 00:15:33,216
life of them and it's just I'm trying to not spend too much on my hobbies

150
00:15:33,280 --> 00:15:37,952
to ship so I've used one that I picked up in a charity shop in a

151
00:15:38,015 --> 00:15:41,952
previous year so it only cost me twenty be which was brilliant it's also a really

152
00:15:41,984 --> 00:15:44,831
nice missiles and I think it goes nicely with the

153
00:15:45,919 --> 00:15:50,239
the greenly leave some in the settlement and that's it for this time thanks for watching
