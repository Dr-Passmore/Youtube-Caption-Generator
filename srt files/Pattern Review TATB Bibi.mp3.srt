00:00:00,544 --> 00:00:02,335
today I'm reviewing the baby skirts

1
00:00:03,904 --> 00:00:08,576
I can sing the baby skirt is part of the stretch book by Tilly ones or

2
00:00:08,831 --> 00:00:13,184
have passing companies to the in the buttons so this is the first pattern in the

3
00:00:13,279 --> 00:00:13,503
book

4
00:00:14,815 --> 00:00:18,527
I made a size for and as you can say I've done the pinnacle variation

5
00:00:20,031 --> 00:00:25,600
so my fabric choice was guided by a mishap on a previous project I think I

6
00:00:25,663 --> 00:00:31,200
mentioned it in my kindergarten an pattern review I accidentally cut into the wrong fabric when

7
00:00:31,327 --> 00:00:36,543
I made my Nana kinda cardigan as Christmas I meant to use a very similar color

8
00:00:36,736 --> 00:00:43,071
but it was a drapier fabric and I meant to use that feather cardigan rather than

9
00:00:43,296 --> 00:00:48,736
this which is a much more stable of it liquor and Ponting's that brick so anyway

10
00:00:48,832 --> 00:00:53,439
was really wanted to start because I had this picked on the address which needed I'm

11
00:00:53,791 --> 00:00:58,720
you know more meters because I had about three meters of it I'm but I managed

12
00:00:58,751 --> 00:01:02,911
to turn around because it turns out that I had enough fabric to make the pinnacle

13
00:01:02,976 --> 00:01:06,496
version of the baby and which is the one I wanted to make out of the

14
00:01:06,559 --> 00:01:12,384
variations I don't wear an awful of skin so I felt that I wouldn't make the

15
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:17,344
baby has an otherwise although saying that now I've made it I made into my mind

16
00:01:17,375 --> 00:01:21,152
on last so yet this fabrics really nice is actually from

17
00:01:22,559 --> 00:01:25,216
haberdashery and to Mitton equal Albers

18
00:01:28,319 --> 00:01:34,015
anyway to divert of town of Devon in the UK and yeah it's the luckily fabric

19
00:01:34,239 --> 00:01:38,143
it hasn't bottle too much a tool I made it a little while ago so I've

20
00:01:38,176 --> 00:01:40,480
had a bit find stepped out and

21
00:01:41,791 --> 00:01:45,344
I do need to I'm this I do apologize for the creases or any to steam

22
00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:51,680
it that's likely and just because it is a bit Greece I probably chapped it someone

23
00:01:51,903 --> 00:01:52,447
without my no

24
00:01:54,143 --> 00:01:59,232
yes so really happy with the fabric choice it works really well with this person in

25
00:01:59,295 --> 00:02:03,328
terms of difficulty it's the very first person in the stretch book for a good reason

26
00:02:03,391 --> 00:02:09,408
because it's the easiest use of a stable fabric of quantity or very thick not to

27
00:02:09,792 --> 00:02:15,423
stretching fabric and yeah there's I'm for panel save for the front one there are two

28
00:02:15,552 --> 00:02:18,815
sighed once energy of the back panel and then you've got

29
00:02:19,936 --> 00:02:26,432
the waist band that the front and back amber also I think you have only inside

30
00:02:26,496 --> 00:02:26,880
as well

31
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,007
so there are many pieces of talk when because they're quite so because they are panel

32
00:02:31,039 --> 00:02:34,720
was it means that you can get it out of a relatively small bit of fabric

33
00:02:34,815 --> 00:02:40,223
so it's a really good espousing you know introduction into its annoyed because you know you

34
00:02:40,287 --> 00:02:44,671
don't have to worry about you know and even if it does go wrong at least

35
00:02:44,703 --> 00:02:48,703
you haven't used too much of our break-ins that makes sense and but it's a it's

36
00:02:49,184 --> 00:02:51,839
it's a very nice pattern to start with the feel beginning with it

37
00:02:53,824 --> 00:02:57,535
because I did the pentacle variation that was very simple as well

38
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:03,936
so what we do with them there are two extra pattern pieces so you've got to

39
00:03:04,511 --> 00:03:07,167
go out with the protection and these stress

40
00:03:08,832 --> 00:03:12,255
but they are on the pattern sheet so you don't need to drop out yourself they're

41
00:03:12,384 --> 00:03:13,440
all they're ready to hand

42
00:03:14,496 --> 00:03:18,432
and yeah the instructions very close so it's very easy to

43
00:03:19,936 --> 00:03:25,376
make this variation the as all telling on the buttons patterns like it mentioned because of

44
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:29,535
me quite a few to the Boston patterns the ship again it's like someone holding a

45
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:36,863
hand through the process it's really nice introduction internet fabrics and and yeah the instructions are

46
00:03:37,024 --> 00:03:37,440
really clear

47
00:03:39,072 --> 00:03:43,583
regarding the designer fit as I mentioned I wasn't really interested in this part of my

48
00:03:43,744 --> 00:03:48,352
first ickle the book I saw you not sure about dele passion and looks more of

49
00:03:48,416 --> 00:03:50,880
the other ones such as you know it's the j-j dress

50
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:57,535
even like a docking top to bottom until I was more into that than making this

51
00:03:58,175 --> 00:04:02,464
I am a pattern however I'm really glad I did really nice to wear and the

52
00:04:02,496 --> 00:04:05,567
great thing is I can wear it both at home and that work I feel like

53
00:04:05,632 --> 00:04:09,535
it's especially the fabric of used it is smart enough to wear to work it's a

54
00:04:09,983 --> 00:04:14,367
it's a decent length I didn't actually like them up as well I'm which sometimes I

55
00:04:14,432 --> 00:04:17,824
do like to add a bit of length yes it's a good length for me anyway

56
00:04:19,648 --> 00:04:23,712
yeah the fabrics nice I'm a nice color that would be suitable to go to work

57
00:04:23,776 --> 00:04:28,864
in and it's really company so although it looks nice and fetich because it's a pencil

58
00:04:28,895 --> 00:04:30,976
skirt designed but it doesn't

59
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:37,279
you know it doesn't still uncomfortable to where it's very static easy as well so we

60
00:04:37,376 --> 00:04:41,183
really good one especially in in the autumn winter to work to work yes know what

61
00:04:41,247 --> 00:04:44,832
I really thought about making a pencil skirt before so it's quite nice because it's made

62
00:04:44,895 --> 00:04:48,032
in the net fabric you have to worry too much about the fit so it's very

63
00:04:48,063 --> 00:04:51,552
good to the introduction to ancile set for following eps the only thing I would say

64
00:04:51,808 --> 00:04:56,544
this you do need to have a bear stretching of fabric and to make sure you

65
00:04:56,671 --> 00:05:03,231
stitch the waistband well because the only real issue I have sometimes is that I'm getting

66
00:05:03,328 --> 00:05:04,096
it over my hips

67
00:05:05,888 --> 00:05:10,463
because will receive the waistband delight to fit on your waist and both my hips are

68
00:05:10,911 --> 00:05:14,687
wider so I do sometimes feel a bit know that's about how will have done the

69
00:05:14,752 --> 00:05:16,704
stitching like and put this on

70
00:05:18,015 --> 00:05:21,600
because there isn't as it all the dome other fastening it is literally just as a

71
00:05:21,664 --> 00:05:26,720
long pitiful the time taken it's a really nice book make you can definitely do it

72
00:05:26,816 --> 00:05:29,824
in the day I'd say you might want to let it hang but we you see

73
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:34,432
the him I'm not sure whether I didn't or now but yeah it's it's a really

74
00:05:34,496 --> 00:05:38,911
quick make if you want something and I stuffed the quick steps I make my doesn't

75
00:05:39,007 --> 00:05:43,743
Michael into this one so in rule I really really like this make and it did

76
00:05:43,808 --> 00:05:47,040
surprise me but that wasn't too sure I do like a pinafored so that's why I

77
00:05:47,104 --> 00:05:50,463
went to the pinnacle variation however I wasn't sure whether I'd really

78
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,839
like this design because I only ever guess it it wore a line I've never really

79
00:05:56,127 --> 00:06:00,256
ever won and so scarce before but yeah I really like the shape it is nice

80
00:06:00,351 --> 00:06:03,839
as a bit more fitted in some of my other place it goes well with them

81
00:06:03,967 --> 00:06:09,888
apparently able top by Jensen or and canned things and but it also goes well with

82
00:06:09,951 --> 00:06:13,600
the Frankie teacher so I liked by a lock with my our version I get someone's

83
00:06:14,015 --> 00:06:17,055
a little bit more casual I probably the way of to work them to be had

84
00:06:17,791 --> 00:06:20,415
and that you have the frankly teacher it's really I deliver it if you want a

85
00:06:20,575 --> 00:06:25,023
slightly at the neckline way that still my eye and and to be ready have got

86
00:06:25,055 --> 00:06:29,376
a decent mount Vernon said quite a few different to ships would go with it that's

87
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:33,855
a really good wardrobe staple I can see myself wearing at Thomas and and yet really

88
00:06:33,951 --> 00:06:38,399
recommended so yeah the only but I did struggle on was sorting out the

89
00:06:39,903 --> 00:06:41,247
where the struck to go so

90
00:06:42,687 --> 00:06:45,440
you can't have to try it on and despite where you not them I feel like

91
00:06:45,503 --> 00:06:48,735
I did a junk that a compass on the skin feels the back I have used

92
00:06:48,768 --> 00:06:49,407
to last them

93
00:06:50,496 --> 00:06:54,175
they looked like a covered places but I had them basically on my bottom job so

94
00:06:54,463 --> 00:06:59,839
I was using up and of already had ever the fight life-size to use and serially

95
00:06:59,936 --> 00:07:03,839
and I've done it quite close to the side seam then you can see I think

96
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:08,032
originally I did put it right up never so I'd seen but adjustment to that wind

97
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:12,704
so you might need to play around with that overall I'm really happy with this make

98
00:07:12,895 --> 00:07:17,343
it it was a lot of fun to make and as really surprised and delighted that

99
00:07:17,567 --> 00:07:17,567
I

100
00:07:18,592 --> 00:07:21,920
liked the and results if that makes sense because it was unusual because it's not my

101
00:07:22,559 --> 00:07:27,808
my natural choice I'm in a person so yeah I'd really recommend it and it's such

102
00:07:27,872 --> 00:07:32,384
a good beginning to fasten I can recommend it more ready for that that reason alone

103
00:07:32,671 --> 00:07:37,119
and even if you know you're quite comfortable with it fabrics it's just I'm quite and

104
00:07:37,183 --> 00:07:38,048
I simple make

105
00:07:39,071 --> 00:07:40,320
and it's not too many pieces

106
00:07:41,407 --> 00:07:42,656
yeah thanks for watching
