hello today I'm reviewing the Frankie t-shirt which comes with the Tilly and the buttons book

1
00:00:11,680 --> 00:00:17,695
stretch I've decided to go for the short sleep variation and I have made a size

2
00:00:17,823 --> 00:00:22,431
for so the fabric I've used is actually one that I wanted to use as part

3
00:00:22,464 --> 00:00:26,239
of my twenty eighteen make mine it's this wonderful

4
00:00:27,327 --> 00:00:32,639
spotty dog tea shutting fabric which I got from fabric land is been sitting in my

5
00:00:32,799 --> 00:00:35,712
stash for well over a year if not longer

6
00:00:36,768 --> 00:00:41,791
and it just seemed perfect for this I'm not sure how well it will last over

7
00:00:41,888 --> 00:00:47,423
time but hopefully if I look take good care of it it will last a while

8
00:00:48,895 --> 00:00:54,080
in terms of clarity for the project and as many people have said the Tilly in

9
00:00:54,111 --> 00:01:00,383
the buttons patterns are wonderfully clear I didn't really have any issues that I can think

10
00:01:00,479 --> 00:01:04,543
of with this pattern everything seemed to work seamlessly

11
00:01:05,695 --> 00:01:10,879
even with the neck band I found I didn't have any trouble I didn't need to

12
00:01:10,975 --> 00:01:15,519
adjust to which I was surprised with I don't know if it's just cause it's quite

13
00:01:15,711 --> 00:01:19,360
a small neck opening but anyway it worked fine

14
00:01:20,608 --> 00:01:25,888
regarding the fit I found that this person fits me really well I guess with a

15
00:01:25,919 --> 00:01:31,360
stretch you don't have to worry as much with adjusting the pattern with regard to do

16
00:01:31,391 --> 00:01:36,991
you know and but starts or whether it goes over your hips as it has a

17
00:01:37,055 --> 00:01:42,496
bit of give and take on it anyway but in terms of some typical adjustments I

18
00:01:42,624 --> 00:01:47,232
make is more about the lengths of the garment as I like to wear quite long

19
00:01:47,552 --> 00:01:52,896
items or I've got quite a long torso but this is actually quite a long top

20
00:01:52,991 --> 00:01:56,000
anyway so it might be if if you've got a short at all so you may

21
00:01:56,127 --> 00:01:57,087
want to shorten it

22
00:01:58,783 --> 00:02:03,903
moving on to the design I think this is a wonderful design I'm a big fan

23
00:02:04,096 --> 00:02:07,711
of Ragland sleeves and from being Anita

24
00:02:09,343 --> 00:02:13,856
and I really love this curved and it's quite hard to tell on this fabric because

25
00:02:13,919 --> 00:02:19,936
it does drape quite well but I really like this curved him and also it dips

26
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:20,735
a bit at the back

27
00:02:21,792 --> 00:02:26,016
while I was making it I was trying to double check that it definitely did dip

28
00:02:26,656 --> 00:02:31,423
in the end I concluded that it must be lower at the bottom

29
00:02:34,048 --> 00:02:39,647
really like the short sleeves as I've mentioned before I prefer wearing short sleeve to long

30
00:02:39,744 --> 00:02:45,983
sleeve just could buy living quiet a humid area of the UK also the neckline it's

31
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:52,160
got I really like the shaping on it and it is quite high up but personally

32
00:02:52,255 --> 00:02:53,919
I like that detail

33
00:02:56,255 --> 00:03:01,664
for time taken this probably only took me about half a day and that's even including

34
00:03:01,792 --> 00:03:07,679
tracing all the past and pieces I can't have decided one Sunday afternoon just to start

35
00:03:07,744 --> 00:03:13,119
another project after I finished another one and I ended up finishing at the same day

36
00:03:13,727 --> 00:03:18,367
so it is a really quick make especially if you've already traced out the pieces overall

37
00:03:18,527 --> 00:03:23,199
I'm really happy with this make I'm really happy with the fabric choice along with the

38
00:03:23,264 --> 00:03:30,080
pattern design I will definitely make another Frankie t-shirt probably more short-sleeved ones although there are

39
00:03:30,175 --> 00:03:34,240
variations and to make obviously ones with longest leaves

40
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:39,360
but I know I've definitely got some other fabric which will work with this as well

41
00:03:39,776 --> 00:03:42,944
and I'd highly recommend it if you do want to make a t-shirt
