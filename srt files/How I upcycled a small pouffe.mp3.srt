00:00:00,800 --> 00:00:03,296
hello today I'm going stream how I made this

1
00:00:05,407 --> 00:00:08,223
as always did like this video and like to see more please don't forget to light

2
00:00:08,255 --> 00:00:14,847
and subscribe if you haven't already so this was originally a perfect my mom patches from

3
00:00:15,008 --> 00:00:18,879
a charity shop and I think she'd been holding on to it for a bit and

4
00:00:18,944 --> 00:00:23,680
one time of this to her she asked whether I'd like to cover it so originally

5
00:00:23,743 --> 00:00:28,511
had this saw a pinkish up history fabric over it as it turned out it was

6
00:00:29,663 --> 00:00:30,975
within another cover

7
00:00:32,063 --> 00:00:38,240
so originally it was a leather purse but that stuck boarding all over the outside anyway

8
00:00:38,720 --> 00:00:43,327
I'll let you watch the highlights of making it it was a very long makes so

9
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:49,344
I will have edited it down quite substantially and then I'll give some feedback on how

10
00:00:49,439 --> 00:00:50,527
I felt it went at the end

11
00:00:53,919 --> 00:00:59,776
to begin with I unpicked the cover that was on the fifth as he can see

12
00:01:00,159 --> 00:01:04,192
in the footage it was quite a simple task actually I was quite surprised at how

13
00:01:04,351 --> 00:01:06,304
easy it was to unpick us

14
00:01:07,424 --> 00:01:12,255
and it probably took me about half an hour in total I did externally ripped the

15
00:01:12,351 --> 00:01:16,351
top peace and I didn't if it's just because the fabric was old or maybe I

16
00:01:16,384 --> 00:01:17,407
was a bit harsh with it

17
00:01:18,431 --> 00:01:19,968
I did retrieve the

18
00:01:21,055 --> 00:01:26,239
I'm called out of it as well I originally thought I was going to use it

19
00:01:26,304 --> 00:01:31,424
in the project but in the end I didn't end up using it the next I

20
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:36,800
measured the pieces from the original from cover to give me an idea on a template

21
00:01:36,928 --> 00:01:42,688
so I measured to get a refined there and then I transferred this onto paper

22
00:01:43,807 --> 00:01:46,304
to get some paper pattern pieces

23
00:02:01,919 --> 00:02:07,776
you can see how I've used a simple ceramic bowl to make the curved edges once

24
00:02:07,872 --> 00:02:13,824
I got the main template I then added a seam allowance around the edge

25
00:02:39,072 --> 00:02:45,856
for the sides I made one long narrow strip so I for the past in peace

26
00:02:46,143 --> 00:02:51,007
I did half the length just to save on paper

27
00:03:08,703 --> 00:03:13,759
for the cover I decided to use some simple calicoes so I had quite a bit

28
00:03:13,792 --> 00:03:14,399
at home anyway

29
00:03:15,871 --> 00:03:21,055
and to be honest this first covered and take an awful lot of calico anyway

30
00:03:22,335 --> 00:03:25,376
it will be a nice plain base material for us

31
00:03:33,087 --> 00:03:39,583
so I saw the two short ends together for the side panel peace and then I

32
00:03:39,871 --> 00:03:43,744
cut in little notches into one of the bases

33
00:03:52,671 --> 00:03:55,167
as you can see here I'm trying to pin it together but

34
00:03:56,192 --> 00:04:03,231
I realized that the measurements didn't work out properly together or they weren't the the original

35
00:04:03,807 --> 00:04:09,055
measurements weren't uniform enough so it wouldn't fit on properly so why I ended up doing

36
00:04:09,119 --> 00:04:15,167
was fitting it around the first taking in the side panel a little bit more because

37
00:04:15,328 --> 00:04:19,903
I hadn't done it twice enough and then I pinned the base peace all the way

38
00:04:20,032 --> 00:04:20,415
round

39
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:28,160
killing it by I just gave it a much tight of it

40
00:04:48,608 --> 00:04:54,399
once I was happy with how I'd pinned it I then tact that into place

41
00:05:02,015 --> 00:05:06,239
once tucked in place I went to the sewing machine and soda and place

42
00:05:13,119 --> 00:05:18,208
once own in place I then put their cover back on to see how it fitted

43
00:05:18,399 --> 00:05:22,880
and I was pretty happy with that and then I tucked in the top raw edge

44
00:05:23,328 --> 00:05:28,671
of the exposed side just again idea of how it would sit level

45
00:05:39,712 --> 00:05:42,496
once I was happy with that I put a couple of pins and to keep it

46
00:05:42,559 --> 00:05:48,959
into place and then took the cover or I pressed into place and then I trimmed

47
00:05:49,888 --> 00:05:53,503
the raw edge just so it was a bit more even although it wouldn't be on

48
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:55,264
a show I thought it might show slightly

49
00:05:56,287 --> 00:06:00,832
through the fabric once trimmed I then put the top piece

50
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:06,623
into place and started pinning it round but this time I couldn't do it and with

51
00:06:07,967 --> 00:06:10,911
it inside out I needed to do it the right way up

52
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:13,312
I noticed on the

53
00:06:14,432 --> 00:06:21,920
that pinkish and fifty cover that I unpicked from it though one panel peace had been

54
00:06:22,239 --> 00:06:26,303
stitched in by hand and I realized that and that was the only way that I'd

55
00:06:26,335 --> 00:06:30,528
be able to do it so that's why I did next I then hand-stitched all the

56
00:06:30,559 --> 00:06:36,127
way round did a simple slip stitch and gradually secured in place the whole way around

57
00:07:02,239 --> 00:07:06,847
once the whole of the base cover with an eye then made a cover over the

58
00:07:06,911 --> 00:07:12,864
top of this so you can see her I'm pinning my original person template into place

59
00:07:12,959 --> 00:07:17,888
and I folded it under to try and mold it to the new shape of the

60
00:07:22,463 --> 00:07:24,063
one side have you that I took it off

61
00:07:28,799 --> 00:07:35,167
then I went about to cut to pieces also wanted the top and a base passing

62
00:07:35,231 --> 00:07:41,920
piece from this however I needed to add a seam allowance on to this I say

63
00:07:42,048 --> 00:07:48,480
seam allowance just them there him all the way around so I added two centimeters to

64
00:07:48,544 --> 00:07:50,816
the outside of it and with the talk and

65
00:07:54,303 --> 00:08:00,000
then pressed one sent me to in on the edges and then a further one centimeters

66
00:08:00,544 --> 00:08:03,231
and stitch that in place to Nathan the edges

67
00:08:30,399 --> 00:08:35,296
I cut out the cat piece from the other fabric I had

68
00:08:36,607 --> 00:08:37,343
so I tried to

69
00:08:38,367 --> 00:08:44,703
have it barely centered in the panel that I cut out I then measured the peace

70
00:08:44,831 --> 00:08:51,807
that I'd cut out and went about to find a nice central place on the top

71
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:58,271
of the earth they used a fabric pen to mark out the rectangle ready for having

72
00:08:58,367 --> 00:08:59,455
it as reverse plicae

73
00:09:05,791 --> 00:09:12,575
so to start with I stitched along the fabric pen line just to reinforce the rectangle

74
00:09:15,552 --> 00:09:16,223
next I

75
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:23,455
marked I think it was about one centimeter in from that stitching line in order to

76
00:09:23,552 --> 00:09:28,000
cut out a bit of the calico and then clipped the corners

77
00:09:30,047 --> 00:09:35,424
and impend the cats that fabric into place then moved up to the so machine and

78
00:09:36,512 --> 00:09:42,015
stitched it in place close to the edge of the rectangular opening

79
00:09:55,520 --> 00:09:59,296
with the top and bottom pieces ready for the outer layer of the path

80
00:10:03,487 --> 00:10:08,447
then marked holds to add blanket stitch to the top and bottom pieces

81
00:10:11,648 --> 00:10:19,135
so I decided to leave one sent me to gap between each hole and I'm using

82
00:10:19,263 --> 00:10:22,176
an all to poke a hole into it

83
00:10:33,632 --> 00:10:36,736
so I go a bit carried away here as you might be able to see so

84
00:10:36,895 --> 00:10:41,312
I got a done needle out and just tested what it would look like before I

85
00:10:41,823 --> 00:10:43,968
pissed all the other holes say I

86
00:10:45,023 --> 00:10:49,184
looked like I did a a fair few stitches just to see what it looked like

87
00:10:49,247 --> 00:10:54,111
and then when I was happy with it I carried on and poked the rest of

88
00:10:54,143 --> 00:10:54,528
the holes

89
00:10:55,552 --> 00:10:56,799
around the edges

90
00:11:19,935 --> 00:11:25,856
so I needed to poke holes into both the top and bottom pieces because this is

91
00:11:25,984 --> 00:11:29,375
how I was going to add my side panels and

92
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:31,679
by koshering

93
00:11:43,583 --> 00:11:48,544
one side packed all the holes through the fabric by then carried on with my blanket

94
00:11:48,607 --> 00:11:54,111
stitch adding blanket search the edge of both the top and bottom pieces

95
00:12:29,664 --> 00:12:34,304
blanket stitch was around the top and bottom pieces I could add the

96
00:12:35,359 --> 00:12:35,968
side panel

97
00:12:37,119 --> 00:12:44,544
so I creatures the sides for this cover anyone who's seen my the three that's on

98
00:12:44,607 --> 00:12:49,216
my sofa will know that these are the same square design and also some of the

99
00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:52,927
same Yun's that have used for this just so it will tie and nicely with the

100
00:12:53,023 --> 00:13:00,288
lounge so what I'm doing here as I'm double koshering the crocheted square panel to the

101
00:13:00,736 --> 00:13:07,616
base piece of the cover so I'm using the blanket stitch edge in order to double

102
00:13:07,648 --> 00:13:13,216
Croatia up to the edge of those squares and essentially is why did I attach the

103
00:13:13,375 --> 00:13:20,288
base peace the whole way round with double crochet and then I flipped it over and

104
00:13:20,383 --> 00:13:23,520
added the top peace in exactly the same way

105
00:13:36,447 --> 00:13:41,375
okay so that's the summary of how I made this but this to recap I obviously

106
00:13:41,536 --> 00:13:46,143
it made a face cover and that's all in calico which I had at home so

107
00:13:46,335 --> 00:13:52,640
originally I did use templates but because it was such a strange shape obviously because it

108
00:13:52,703 --> 00:13:56,895
is an old person and it's probably gilded distorted by the time I ended up having

109
00:13:56,960 --> 00:14:00,768
to just winger and pen at once I've made the base layer I then made a

110
00:14:00,992 --> 00:14:07,039
talk piece of base peace and by crochets the side panels these approaches words are the

111
00:14:07,104 --> 00:14:11,552
ones that I have come the throw in my lunch on the safer so originally I

112
00:14:11,679 --> 00:14:16,703
approached twenty forswears because I thought that would be enough and then I realized once I

113
00:14:16,768 --> 00:14:21,151
don't see any course was that it needed a little bit more so I approach it

114
00:14:21,216 --> 00:14:26,495
another for the fabric on the fault is from the purse that I already had so

115
00:14:26,559 --> 00:14:31,872
that's a much larger one which I recovered with my mom years ago and this was

116
00:14:31,935 --> 00:14:35,552
just a remnant so I didn't have an awful lot of the fabric left it used

117
00:14:35,583 --> 00:14:39,903
to be I think it was an ikea Kherson anyway was quite a small panel and

118
00:14:40,064 --> 00:14:46,719
was obviously centered the only giant cat on this panel for the other Pathak so on

119
00:14:46,815 --> 00:14:50,528
this one I only had one cats left and it's one of the smaller cats so

120
00:14:50,624 --> 00:14:55,648
it's quite nice is and so it not towards the other pursed as equally it's got

121
00:14:55,711 --> 00:14:59,616
a small the cat to go proportion with the smaller poeticize because I didn't have enough

122
00:14:59,648 --> 00:15:03,392
fabric I wanted to allocate on to the top originally I was just going to be

123
00:15:03,424 --> 00:15:06,656
around the outline and that I realized a much better way to do it wants to

124
00:15:07,231 --> 00:15:12,031
essential to reverse of the hay and and create this window which I'm really happy with

125
00:15:12,671 --> 00:15:18,239
and had even all to go and controls to do blanket stitch desiccants I received on

126
00:15:18,304 --> 00:15:23,263
a double Pam on here and it was why hard to puncture a blunt needle into

127
00:15:23,328 --> 00:15:28,960
the calico so my reflections after making it I'm really happy with it it's come out

128
00:15:29,119 --> 00:15:33,536
just as I imagined actually which is great I am a little bit concerned that this

129
00:15:33,599 --> 00:15:38,176
caligo might not be substantial enough I'm not sure how long that will last and but

130
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:42,080
saying that you know Zuma's I look after hopefully of all lost by a long time

131
00:15:42,335 --> 00:15:46,943
one issue is that you can't take the cover off and or you need to recruit

132
00:15:46,976 --> 00:15:50,783
sure echo and which would take a long time and I'm sure I would be that

133
00:15:50,848 --> 00:15:55,072
make collated so what I have done and this was went on the suggestion as well

134
00:15:55,200 --> 00:16:00,703
as I put some rain and stain protector and so it protects materials so I think

135
00:16:00,799 --> 00:16:04,960
I put this at the same the market at some point I actually bet on the

136
00:16:05,216 --> 00:16:07,392
show the bag or made the Debbie show of this back

137
00:16:08,512 --> 00:16:11,392
and because that's kind of made out of the needle cord and I was worried right

138
00:16:11,455 --> 00:16:16,671
again the rocky so I have I did spring back with this as well don't just

139
00:16:16,736 --> 00:16:21,536
put it all over and hopefully that will give it a fair resistance disdains and getting

140
00:16:21,599 --> 00:16:26,335
McKee yeah they were I'm really happy I think it's a lovely besides that which is

141
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:30,559
the reason why I wanted to recover it in the first place obviously if you don't

142
00:16:30,591 --> 00:16:36,607
have one to cover yourself or redesign what you can do is to seven managements so

143
00:16:36,768 --> 00:16:39,520
like he did that the start when I made the Paston I mean I could use

144
00:16:39,583 --> 00:16:44,512
those pieces to make them almost a replica of this it would just be a lot

145
00:16:44,575 --> 00:16:48,223
more uniform in shape if that makes sense it in this is quite nice sides actually

146
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:52,575
for if you're into meditation as well because it's not too high off the ground but

147
00:16:52,640 --> 00:16:58,335
just enough to and elevate your hips above your feet and sometimes I quite like to

148
00:16:58,783 --> 00:17:02,080
and sit closer to the ground work is why we still do you have a chronic

149
00:17:02,271 --> 00:17:08,703
back health issue and I find it really beneficial just set more in a meditative pose

150
00:17:09,631 --> 00:17:13,696
because it can help improve my posture or at least I hope it does any way

151
00:17:13,823 --> 00:17:17,631
by that it for this time I hope you enjoy that uncertainly happy lot of was

152
00:17:18,112 --> 00:17:21,056
a new bit of they call in my house it sit for this time thanks for

153
00:17:21,119 --> 00:17:21,407
watching
