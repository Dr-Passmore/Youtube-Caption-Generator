00:00:06,815 --> 00:00:10,975
hello its Clary from club or creation today I thought I do a little bit of

1
00:00:11,039 --> 00:00:15,711
a craft hall and over the last month I've brought a lot more than I usually

2
00:00:15,807 --> 00:00:23,295
do I'm just because they're have been some authors around which I couldn't refuse so there

3
00:00:23,327 --> 00:00:27,968
I've been to a few different charity shops in the local area I've also been to

4
00:00:28,191 --> 00:00:28,959
hobby craft

5
00:00:31,072 --> 00:00:34,591
yeah I think Oh yeah I got a couple of things from out there as well

6
00:00:34,784 --> 00:00:38,944
so I'm just gonna quickly show them and let you know if I've got a project

7
00:00:39,136 --> 00:00:40,703
for them or not

8
00:00:42,911 --> 00:00:48,096
so the first fabric I'm going to show you I've got in Helston the other week

9
00:00:48,863 --> 00:00:52,863
I haven't got much to show you because as you may be able to tell I've

10
00:00:52,928 --> 00:00:54,944
already got something out of it

11
00:00:57,119 --> 00:01:01,855
I can't show what I've made with it quite yet as I'm it's a person test

12
00:01:01,951 --> 00:01:02,464
for someone

13
00:01:04,959 --> 00:01:11,232
um yeah basically I was trying to find some nice knit fabric to use for this

14
00:01:11,552 --> 00:01:18,208
I'm test pattern and fortunately and we happened to go into this charity shop on the

15
00:01:18,272 --> 00:01:23,839
way back from something else and it matched the other fabric I had for this project

16
00:01:24,127 --> 00:01:27,232
a lot better than the other scraps I had in my stash so

17
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:31,807
I picked this up the it's quite a nice medium-weight knit

18
00:01:33,632 --> 00:01:38,879
it feels really nice and soft that was about probably just over a meter of it

19
00:01:41,695 --> 00:01:45,760
no more I'm definitely not meter and a half the I have managed to squeeze out

20
00:01:45,823 --> 00:01:51,328
the project I wanted for it and I'm hoping possibly to do and a headband to

21
00:01:51,391 --> 00:01:56,671
go with it must be looking at the unstitch sisters ones that they've done recently as

22
00:01:56,736 --> 00:02:01,727
I think it would damn much what I've done really well so yeah that's some what's

23
00:02:01,823 --> 00:02:06,176
left of that fabric it already been knew straight away which is very unusual to me

24
00:02:08,095 --> 00:02:13,664
the other fabric I got from Helston in a different charity shop is this

25
00:02:16,095 --> 00:02:20,895
it's quite pink actually this fabric which is unusual for me and I don't tend to

26
00:02:20,927 --> 00:02:24,735
wear a lot think I'm not very keen on the color pink I'd much rather wear

27
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:24,992
red

28
00:02:26,016 --> 00:02:27,455
and which I'm wearing at the moment

29
00:02:28,576 --> 00:02:28,703
so

30
00:02:30,496 --> 00:02:33,695
I'm not sure what type of fabric it is and

31
00:02:36,416 --> 00:02:39,231
I was hoping it was a crave but I'm not too sure now it's not a

32
00:02:39,296 --> 00:02:40,000
soft so

33
00:02:41,983 --> 00:02:45,951
not completely sure I'm going to do with it I'm thinking possibly address

34
00:02:47,647 --> 00:02:51,007
but it just depends on not sure if it be to it chief or that so

35
00:02:51,136 --> 00:02:54,944
I kind of need to do a bit more investigating on this spit the yard is

36
00:02:55,455 --> 00:03:00,128
a fair bit of fabric air actually apartment by how much but the definitely is enough

37
00:03:00,223 --> 00:03:01,600
to do address if I wanted to

38
00:03:02,623 --> 00:03:07,807
the other day I went to a much place a charity shop in Penryn I think

39
00:03:07,871 --> 00:03:13,216
it's called Penryn treasures and they were having sailed on their items and I managed to

40
00:03:13,248 --> 00:03:14,335
pick up this lovely

41
00:03:15,455 --> 00:03:18,848
rettore fabric and from there for fifty peace

42
00:03:21,503 --> 00:03:22,272
I think that's about

43
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:28,800
to know whether there's a good couple of meters there and it's quite wide

44
00:03:29,888 --> 00:03:33,759
it's got lovely print and and it will drape really nicely you say

45
00:03:35,552 --> 00:03:39,231
again I'm not sure what I'm going to make out of it or when I'm going

46
00:03:39,296 --> 00:03:44,992
to make something out of it hopefully soon and I do have other things in mind

47
00:03:45,055 --> 00:03:46,527
at the moment so I think

48
00:03:48,223 --> 00:03:49,535
it would probably make

49
00:03:51,391 --> 00:03:52,511
quite a nice

50
00:03:54,591 --> 00:03:57,695
probably quite a nice dress I guess you could do a blouse with well

51
00:03:59,647 --> 00:04:03,936
nice big print on it so so I'm looking forward to you using it by just

52
00:04:03,968 --> 00:04:09,248
need to find the right happen for it first I think in the charity shops as

53
00:04:09,343 --> 00:04:14,688
well I was lucky enough to find some sewing patterns a lot of the charity shops

54
00:04:15,583 --> 00:04:21,343
close to me anyway have really gone off and like some sewing persons the one when

55
00:04:21,503 --> 00:04:26,911
there was first looking at sewing passions there they used to be really cheap but you

56
00:04:26,976 --> 00:04:33,920
know tunnel twenty pee and more recently especially in firmus it's about one pound fifty to

57
00:04:34,015 --> 00:04:38,496
to found and these are for persons you know which have already been used and cut

58
00:04:38,592 --> 00:04:40,000
up might be torn of it

59
00:04:41,376 --> 00:04:45,855
so I was really pleased to find in Penryn Carmen brought the charity shop called but

60
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:51,872
it's a newer one on the high street and I found some sowan passenger for twenty

61
00:04:51,936 --> 00:04:57,152
five p which is a really good price and if it makes you you know because

62
00:04:57,216 --> 00:05:02,592
sometimes you don't know it someone's cut the wise you want or not so

63
00:05:03,615 --> 00:05:08,000
you might be purchasing one then then you find out part of missing or you know

64
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:12,511
you can't retrieve the size you want so yes so I've got a few

65
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:20,223
the first one I got is this make it easy and it's in a pouch

66
00:05:22,399 --> 00:05:27,776
shows you how to make a trench coat plus various variations and there's also a long

67
00:05:27,872 --> 00:05:32,320
nice us lace trim on there as well which is probably quite nice for the hot

68
00:05:32,351 --> 00:05:35,872
weather we're having at the moment so inside it comes with

69
00:05:37,696 --> 00:05:38,911
the full person thesis

70
00:05:40,032 --> 00:05:43,552
it looks like someone has cut out a bit of this I'm not sure

71
00:05:45,503 --> 00:05:49,152
they've made and yes and then there's the book that as well that comes with it

72
00:05:49,247 --> 00:05:54,335
as well so yeah there is this lovely trenchcoat I've never made a cape before I'm

73
00:05:54,368 --> 00:05:59,967
not sure if that's something I want to do with my sewing and this does look

74
00:06:00,032 --> 00:06:05,984
like a lovely patterned there are lots of lovely detailed pictures for each section and ways

75
00:06:06,048 --> 00:06:06,559
that you can

76
00:06:07,872 --> 00:06:08,959
make them much it

77
00:06:10,144 --> 00:06:14,911
also variation where they made it into a dressing gown which is why nice to see

78
00:06:15,936 --> 00:06:19,776
there's also a coatdress but I don't think I'll be making

79
00:06:21,407 --> 00:06:25,183
bit of the night he looked quite nice and simple safe and which is probably a

80
00:06:25,216 --> 00:06:27,615
bit more realistic for my skills at a moment's

81
00:06:29,503 --> 00:06:35,488
this next pattern is a butter passion and actually from fabric land which

82
00:06:37,312 --> 00:06:38,432
is one of my favorite shops

83
00:06:39,743 --> 00:06:45,920
with this lairing pattern I was really drawn to the design I've previously had I'm ready

84
00:06:46,015 --> 00:06:52,127
to where short thoughts tops which just like the ones on the front cover and already

85
00:06:52,223 --> 00:06:58,496
like that sort of uncurved and at the top and then the loose of it for

86
00:06:58,559 --> 00:06:59,264
the rest of it

87
00:07:01,023 --> 00:07:02,144
so I'm not sure

88
00:07:05,567 --> 00:07:11,264
not completely sure what guys have been can hear or a suffice has been caught to

89
00:07:13,631 --> 00:07:14,623
doesn't look like

90
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,312
that it's being cast a to

91
00:07:19,776 --> 00:07:25,376
actually it looks like none of this person has seen that which is brilliant because it

92
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:26,111
means that

93
00:07:27,839 --> 00:07:32,864
I've definitely got my size there which I think I'm the top size for this pattern

94
00:07:32,959 --> 00:07:33,216
anyway

95
00:07:34,656 --> 00:07:38,399
but you so for twenty five p for a baton that you know

96
00:07:39,488 --> 00:07:41,855
is something that I would wear I'm really happy with that

97
00:07:43,839 --> 00:07:47,615
the next one I feel like I'm I actually have this pattern from a charity shops

98
00:07:48,287 --> 00:07:52,992
and which is fine because I think this is a slightly different side so I picked

99
00:07:53,055 --> 00:07:58,944
this up firstly because it was only twenty five peace and and secondly because it's a

100
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:03,743
nice nyt design I might just have one similar to this I'm not sure what I

101
00:08:03,839 --> 00:08:06,687
thought if I wanted to make any of the rest of my family

102
00:08:07,936 --> 00:08:09,343
something for them I could

103
00:08:10,656 --> 00:08:14,239
use this if it is a different size to the one I've already got I feel

104
00:08:14,272 --> 00:08:18,847
like I might have the size down from this one I would they got this and

105
00:08:19,231 --> 00:08:20,671
bedded there's a blouse

106
00:08:22,623 --> 00:08:26,816
yet another one I'm not sure when I'm going to make that and probably more likely

107
00:08:26,911 --> 00:08:28,799
to make the other talk first so

108
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:32,799
that will probably be added to my stash but the interim

109
00:08:34,432 --> 00:08:42,880
the final things I picked up from this particular cherty shop is than this random pattern

110
00:08:43,072 --> 00:08:43,903
so I don't know

111
00:08:45,184 --> 00:08:46,591
what this was from

112
00:08:47,807 --> 00:08:53,984
dozen Oh okay it's a cupcakes for Clara on then it's got coffee right from twenty

113
00:08:54,047 --> 00:08:58,656
twelve so um yeah you can kind of make I mean I yeah this is a

114
00:08:58,943 --> 00:09:01,056
rabbit though I'm you can make a rabbit

115
00:09:02,271 --> 00:09:03,072
fastie it's called

116
00:09:04,127 --> 00:09:08,320
make your own rabbits fasci or you can also make

117
00:09:10,367 --> 00:09:12,671
you can also make a kitty fasces know

118
00:09:14,463 --> 00:09:18,367
the choice is yours I just thought it looked like quite a nice simple

119
00:09:19,968 --> 00:09:22,239
fairly simple makes they just them

120
00:09:23,263 --> 00:09:24,223
and I think also

121
00:09:25,408 --> 00:09:31,424
so what you do is you trace the pictures and these templates here but I think

122
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:34,176
I'm someone's already traced a bit for me he's

123
00:09:36,575 --> 00:09:40,320
just need to double check it but I might already be partially left

124
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:48,223
doesn't like quite a nice sweet idea so you know it might make one of these

125
00:09:48,351 --> 00:09:53,312
are my name I'm not sure now from the charity shops that I got the fifty

126
00:09:53,375 --> 00:09:55,872
p fabric I also got this lovely

127
00:09:56,927 --> 00:10:01,440
box and its listed as sewing patterns on that but it's not

128
00:10:02,624 --> 00:10:09,280
it's actually a little compendium of different and sewing techniques just to guide you through so

129
00:10:12,351 --> 00:10:15,648
I think I've got this it says to pound on the top that they actually gave

130
00:10:15,711 --> 00:10:16,736
it to me for a patent

131
00:10:19,583 --> 00:10:23,776
because they were having their so so yeah each bit so it's got an eight of

132
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:30,783
them on it and it's all conveniently in this little box so if I just bring

133
00:10:30,848 --> 00:10:31,328
it over

134
00:10:32,479 --> 00:10:32,864
and

135
00:10:35,487 --> 00:10:39,968
so if I take out a for now just so I can chew what's on one

136
00:10:40,031 --> 00:10:42,719
of these on each and card for the

137
00:10:43,744 --> 00:10:47,935
letter so for a its call all of them listed for

138
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:54,080
alterations to patterns and then it lists the cards that you need to go to to

139
00:10:54,143 --> 00:11:01,504
look at alterations farmhold back bust combining two patterns all of those are down there on

140
00:11:01,632 --> 00:11:04,736
left and and there's also for a plea case so then

141
00:11:06,015 --> 00:11:10,367
in front of them is all of the cards for a so on the front you

142
00:11:10,463 --> 00:11:12,479
can see there's the armhole

143
00:11:13,504 --> 00:11:15,552
alterations that you can look at so

144
00:11:17,823 --> 00:11:20,416
and then on the back there's alterations to passions

145
00:11:21,664 --> 00:11:23,007
which its own card a one

146
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:28,703
just though I mean I have got some older

147
00:11:29,728 --> 00:11:33,664
sewing books from charity shop and I think I've got one from my name as well

148
00:11:34,271 --> 00:11:37,504
and that this just looks quite nice if you want to to quick reference you can

149
00:11:37,567 --> 00:11:38,719
just get away at which

150
00:11:40,064 --> 00:11:44,383
which techniques I want to look at I quite like that I know I've seen one

151
00:11:44,512 --> 00:11:45,632
I think it's under said

152
00:11:46,943 --> 00:11:48,864
on the god for that it's got

153
00:11:49,952 --> 00:11:55,616
and Zip's at the very top one is avoiding them so if you really don't want

154
00:11:55,648 --> 00:12:01,375
to make is it it gives you advice on defending what you're making how you can

155
00:12:01,984 --> 00:12:02,559
go about

156
00:12:04,831 --> 00:12:08,223
creating a different fastening or avoiding a fastening altogether

157
00:12:09,728 --> 00:12:13,823
say I was really pleased with this and I just think it looks really sweet and

158
00:12:13,888 --> 00:12:17,664
it's a lovely archive that I can look through when I'm

159
00:12:18,719 --> 00:12:22,559
if I get stuck on the pattern or I am quite interested with with that I'm

160
00:12:22,687 --> 00:12:27,231
combining two patterns one say it's definitely worth having a flip through

161
00:12:28,383 --> 00:12:32,255
so the rest of my whole is from holy Crafton as to say

162
00:12:33,312 --> 00:12:37,440
a lot of my stuff was from the church choked normally I have been trying to

163
00:12:37,919 --> 00:12:43,007
buy less fabric just because I've made flat and there's a lot less storage space all

164
00:12:43,039 --> 00:12:43,135
they

165
00:12:44,671 --> 00:12:49,504
there a look there are more benefits to living in this flat it does mean that

166
00:12:49,728 --> 00:12:54,656
I can't store things the same way you see and this means that my fabric stash

167
00:12:54,783 --> 00:12:57,119
does need to go down drastically

168
00:12:58,624 --> 00:13:02,880
anyway so I'm gonna show you the stuff from hobby craft they had a sale I

169
00:13:03,007 --> 00:13:07,776
think it was last month so probably the start a last months I bought these

170
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:13,408
so the first thing I got it's a bit creased because I need to iron it

171
00:13:15,104 --> 00:13:17,632
is this lovely into the woods

172
00:13:19,807 --> 00:13:21,088
cotton fabric so

173
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:27,872
actually got more than I think I asked for it was near the end of the

174
00:13:27,968 --> 00:13:28,223
role

175
00:13:29,695 --> 00:13:35,648
so it's fairly in I mean it feels really soft so I'm just wondering what to

176
00:13:35,711 --> 00:13:40,255
make that why they're going to make something for my knee perhaps the dress

177
00:13:42,239 --> 00:13:47,168
or otherwise I'm just trying to work out if it's some it cannot to make some

178
00:13:47,903 --> 00:13:50,911
crops and pajama bottoms will cut from a short

179
00:13:54,367 --> 00:13:56,159
if it's got on the side where it's from

180
00:13:59,807 --> 00:14:01,760
from unholy craft anyway

181
00:14:02,783 --> 00:14:06,111
and it was half price I think it was for found to me to say

182
00:14:07,872 --> 00:14:10,432
I asked for me to but I think I've got about meter and after

183
00:14:11,744 --> 00:14:16,351
the other fabric and the same collection which I'll have to look up and link

184
00:14:17,567 --> 00:14:18,271
I got this

185
00:14:19,616 --> 00:14:22,559
I think I've just got to me to hear because it was at the end of

186
00:14:22,591 --> 00:14:26,719
the rock and again it goes of the and bare and

187
00:14:27,872 --> 00:14:32,736
fox designs got head shrugs and leaves on can I just thought it is really pretty

188
00:14:32,831 --> 00:14:34,432
and it's probably something I'll make

189
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:42,111
and something for my niece with whether it's a garment or making a bag for her

190
00:14:42,239 --> 00:14:46,432
I'm not completely sure yet the final thing I got from where we craft is this

191
00:14:46,528 --> 00:14:54,783
huge would of jersey fabric now this jersey fabric was half price I think it's normally

192
00:14:54,976 --> 00:15:00,351
eight pounds and meter but I got it for for pans a meter which is a

193
00:15:00,512 --> 00:15:01,375
really good price

194
00:15:02,911 --> 00:15:06,848
and so it it looks like a single net but you can see the pile on

195
00:15:06,911 --> 00:15:11,104
the back and I asked before meters although I think I've got about four and a

196
00:15:11,135 --> 00:15:16,544
half metres saying that I have seen a stain on it which I probably won't find

197
00:15:16,640 --> 00:15:17,088
now but

198
00:15:18,463 --> 00:15:22,719
so I'm a bit disappointed with that but saying that is still benefited from an extra

199
00:15:22,783 --> 00:15:26,687
half meter so as long as I can cut out what I want that fine I'm

200
00:15:26,815 --> 00:15:33,343
torn between making a journey dress a cocoa dress or perhaps and another Molly dress

201
00:15:34,463 --> 00:15:39,679
there's also I've got and Wendy was sewing with nets book so I'm wondering whether to

202
00:15:39,744 --> 00:15:43,200
make the t-shirt dress out of that as well so

203
00:15:45,471 --> 00:15:48,768
that have been looking for a lovely starky fabric for ages I'm now

204
00:15:50,239 --> 00:15:52,447
wondering what to make with it just because

205
00:15:53,536 --> 00:15:57,056
I probably make to dress about this or I'm hoping I can because it is a

206
00:15:57,151 --> 00:16:02,752
wide fabric it's just I'm deciding which two dresses to make below probably be dresses

207
00:16:03,903 --> 00:16:09,247
and that's as far as I've got finally the Brandon once my craft whole is and

208
00:16:09,919 --> 00:16:12,479
that I got these from asda so the

209
00:16:14,495 --> 00:16:14,783
sheet

210
00:16:17,343 --> 00:16:21,664
these bar sheets are a hundred sense meters wide by a hundred and fifty cents meters

211
00:16:22,848 --> 00:16:28,223
and they were half priced so I think there were four pounds each now what I

212
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:34,239
want to make with these I've made a couple of beach dresses and I've recently resorted

213
00:16:34,304 --> 00:16:41,088
to hours just because telling fabrics really expensive I don't live near any

214
00:16:42,304 --> 00:16:43,648
major fabric shocks

215
00:16:44,799 --> 00:16:50,271
so I wanted to make another beach dress but I didn't want it to be an

216
00:16:50,752 --> 00:16:56,575
already bland color so I made this yellow one the other month we want to to

217
00:16:56,671 --> 00:17:01,632
again so following that I've seen some people who he was

218
00:17:02,687 --> 00:17:04,000
wearing these really nice

219
00:17:07,040 --> 00:17:10,527
towel throw over there thought of I mean a lot of the ones I've seen have

220
00:17:10,560 --> 00:17:14,463
heard I don't know sir only want one with his but the gullibly sort of kimono

221
00:17:14,624 --> 00:17:19,135
sleeves on them so you can just throw on after you've been in the sea and

222
00:17:19,199 --> 00:17:23,008
as I live really close to the sea I thought it would be really nice to

223
00:17:23,072 --> 00:17:24,160
make one of those so

224
00:17:25,439 --> 00:17:30,687
I do have a plan for these at least and the I just thought four pounds

225
00:17:30,784 --> 00:17:32,128
for a meter of a

226
00:17:33,504 --> 00:17:39,583
meter of fabric is really good and then I sinned callable so that's why bought those

227
00:17:39,680 --> 00:17:39,776
two

228
00:17:40,927 --> 00:17:45,407
okay well that's everything for this time I hope you've enjoyed it and hope the will

229
00:17:45,439 --> 00:17:48,703
be vaccine to show you what I've made with these things thanks
