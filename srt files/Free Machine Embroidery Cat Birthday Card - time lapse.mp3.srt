hello today I'm showing you a video of a recent birthday card that I made using

1
00:00:04,831 --> 00:00:09,600
free machine embroidery so as you can see it's a picture of a cat wearing a

2
00:00:09,696 --> 00:00:12,864
party hat and sitting in front of a birthday cake

3
00:00:14,048 --> 00:00:18,687
obviously I don't recommend but in your cat right by a lit candle but this is

4
00:00:18,784 --> 00:00:20,447
just for humorous effect

5
00:00:22,336 --> 00:00:28,319
okay so to start with I traced a drawing of a cat's so I looked online

6
00:00:28,736 --> 00:00:33,312
for something that looked like the idea I had in my head

7
00:00:34,431 --> 00:00:40,063
just to give me something to face my drawing off so I found a picture of

8
00:00:40,159 --> 00:00:46,911
a real cat that was sitting in front of the cake I then drew my own

9
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:52,223
version from that so I drew a more I guess comic looking cat

10
00:00:53,439 --> 00:00:59,456
and I didn't outline of this I then drew it on the computer so I used

11
00:00:59,583 --> 00:01:03,807
a simple drawing software the one I've got his Leonardo

12
00:01:05,055 --> 00:01:10,304
and with this I printed it off to the size I wanted that would fit my

13
00:01:10,463 --> 00:01:16,064
card template so once I'd printed off the design in the size that I wanted they

14
00:01:16,160 --> 00:01:22,624
would fit on to my piece of card I used a fabric pen which would vanish

15
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:27,583
over time I have used the water soluble fabric hands but I don't if it's just

16
00:01:27,615 --> 00:01:31,552
the one I was using or it's the quality of the thread I'm using I think

17
00:01:31,872 --> 00:01:38,431
I'm his hope and see not that great I think the color from the thread the

18
00:01:38,527 --> 00:01:43,391
die from it was running and obviously that's not a brilliant effect that you want on

19
00:01:43,456 --> 00:01:48,863
your final design so to begin with I used a thread to go all the way

20
00:01:48,991 --> 00:01:55,167
around my design so think on the plate and the cake I used a black thread

21
00:01:55,776 --> 00:01:58,367
and I used a gray thread around the cats

22
00:02:14,815 --> 00:02:18,656
and you can see a wasn't too happy how I did the eyes on the cats

23
00:02:18,815 --> 00:02:24,800
I was trying to make them look a bit more realistic like cats and but in

24
00:02:24,863 --> 00:02:31,328
the end I just went for a classic cartoon dot eyes just because they're so much

25
00:02:31,423 --> 00:02:33,408
easier to do in free machine embroidery

26
00:02:34,591 --> 00:02:39,936
and yeah I've obviously got some hang often doing other style eyes C s once I'd

27
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:44,287
correct at the eyes I carried on going round to the design so I added a

28
00:02:44,352 --> 00:02:50,432
little sort of pompom onto the top of the birthday hat so for the tabby markings

29
00:02:50,656 --> 00:02:57,727
I switched my machine stitch setting to a zigzag variation I actually use the ones where

30
00:02:57,888 --> 00:03:01,503
it varies from short zigzag to long

31
00:03:03,264 --> 00:03:06,880
as you can see so it kind of added a bit more texture to the design

32
00:03:08,479 --> 00:03:13,055
so I'd really recommend that if you're doing a bit free machine embroidery have a go

33
00:03:13,216 --> 00:03:17,983
at some of the other stitches they can come out quite nice you could always just

34
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:22,304
use you don't even need to use the free machine embroidery fit on that section you

35
00:03:22,367 --> 00:03:28,544
could have just had it on the regular precipice and but I mean it's I guess

36
00:03:28,639 --> 00:03:33,440
you've got a bit more control on how place the stitches are and it's just I'm

37
00:03:33,567 --> 00:03:37,951
because I was obviously using the three machine fit start with I would have had to

38
00:03:38,591 --> 00:03:45,151
take in that off and you know put another press the foot back and so just

39
00:03:45,216 --> 00:03:50,399
a bit laziness really that I stuck with the free machine foot as well for the

40
00:03:50,496 --> 00:03:54,751
markings on the face I went down to the Smalls' exact setting so will we see

41
00:03:54,783 --> 00:03:59,968
if you do you have a machine which where you can adjust the stitch wits as

42
00:04:00,031 --> 00:04:04,000
well as the length I think mine only does length but if you do have one

43
00:04:04,063 --> 00:04:09,888
week and and adjust the with you can oversee I'm completely table at that which is

44
00:04:10,048 --> 00:04:15,647
excellent for the face because you don't want the the tabby markings to be quite as

45
00:04:15,776 --> 00:04:16,223
weitere

46
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:40,415
so once I was happy with all of the stitching for this particular card I decided

47
00:04:40,447 --> 00:04:46,976
to use some fabric pastorals so I just had these I'm hanging around from when I've

48
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:52,415
done textiles in the past I'm facing this cat or my nans cat so this was

49
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:57,600
a card for my Nance and so as a result so she's got a ginger happy

50
00:04:57,727 --> 00:05:04,160
but quite a pale ginger to be so I was trying to trying to get the

51
00:05:04,384 --> 00:05:10,335
tone correct for her cat I will say use the pastor's to create the color on

52
00:05:10,592 --> 00:05:17,023
the plate the cake the candlestick and the hats with these past was basically you can

53
00:05:17,407 --> 00:05:22,368
put a bit on the fabric and then use a bit of water to help spread

54
00:05:22,463 --> 00:05:26,720
it and lighten the shade and as you can see the near the plate it has

55
00:05:26,847 --> 00:05:31,104
actually run a bit over the line marks though it's just something to be aware of

56
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:33,088
if you do decide to use them yourself

57
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:39,264
okay so that's the end results I hope you enjoyed this video and as always if
