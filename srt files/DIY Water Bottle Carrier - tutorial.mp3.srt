00:00:00,319 --> 00:00:04,288
hello today I'm going to share a tutorial with you on how to make a water

1
00:00:04,352 --> 00:00:08,928
bottle carrier as always if you enjoy the video please don't forget to like it the

2
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:14,079
subscribe if you haven't already so here on the table I've got all of the fabric

3
00:00:14,144 --> 00:00:19,327
pieces that I need already and cut out but I'll just quickly go through how I

4
00:00:20,128 --> 00:00:24,511
measured up those pieces the first measurement I took was the height of the water bottle

5
00:00:24,607 --> 00:00:29,823
so basically from the base up until the point I wanted the main bit of the

6
00:00:29,888 --> 00:00:35,391
carrier to go up to and the other measurement I took was the circumference at the

7
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:39,840
widest point around the water bottle so the first piece that I caught out with the

8
00:00:39,967 --> 00:00:44,256
outer peace so you caught one of these in your main fabric and I added a

9
00:00:44,319 --> 00:00:47,391
feasible police to mind just because I had a bit spare from when I made my

10
00:00:48,127 --> 00:00:54,015
I'm shoulder back in order to work out the width of the outer peace I calculated

11
00:00:54,144 --> 00:00:58,944
the circumference and then added to lots of seam allowance so on mine I believe I

12
00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:04,031
used a one centimeter same Alonso I just added two centimeters to the measurements for the

13
00:01:04,255 --> 00:01:11,328
circumference Stouffer the height I did the heightened centimeters past two centimeters from my to lots

14
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:15,807
the seam allowance and then I added to lots of one point two centimeters because that's

15
00:01:15,872 --> 00:01:20,288
how big I wanted the casing to be the next piece I measured out was the

16
00:01:20,671 --> 00:01:25,120
lining so I caught one of these in the lining fabric I didn't put any fuel

17
00:01:25,183 --> 00:01:30,176
police on this piece so for the what I did the circumference measurement again plus the

18
00:01:30,239 --> 00:01:35,680
seamount and for the length of it I did that height measurement plus two lots of

19
00:01:35,744 --> 00:01:40,959
the same allowance the next pieces I cut out with the basis for both the outer

20
00:01:41,055 --> 00:01:46,720
peace and the lining so for this I took the circumference measurement divided it by pie

21
00:01:46,975 --> 00:01:51,424
which is three point one for then with the answer to that I divided it by

22
00:01:51,648 --> 00:01:55,968
two to get the radius of my circle and and then I added one lot of

23
00:01:56,031 --> 00:02:00,096
seam allowance I'm just because I was using a compass to draw this out so that

24
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:04,223
just gave me an idea on how to measure it out using the radius next I

25
00:02:04,351 --> 00:02:07,519
cut out the strap basis so for this you need to cut out to in the

26
00:02:07,552 --> 00:02:11,391
main fabric and to in the lining fabric and interface all of the pieces just to

27
00:02:11,455 --> 00:02:16,384
give it a bit more strength so you need to cut it to the desired voice

28
00:02:16,479 --> 00:02:20,447
over this you need to cut it to the width of your darings and also the

29
00:02:20,703 --> 00:02:26,048
desired length you want it to be once folded over and be sure to add the

30
00:02:26,175 --> 00:02:30,848
seam allowance on both the with and the height the final pieces that I cut worth

31
00:02:30,944 --> 00:02:34,304
of the strap so I caught one in the main fabric and one in the lining

32
00:02:34,399 --> 00:02:40,000
fabric again I used in facing just to strengthen both bits of fabric or so it's

33
00:02:40,063 --> 00:02:44,095
good to mention that you will also need to D-rings and which will oversee affect them

34
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:50,783
with of the straps and the starbases to swivel clasps which a correspondent with a slider

35
00:02:51,039 --> 00:02:55,264
again will need to be a similar measurement to the D-rings and swingle clasps and you'll

36
00:02:55,391 --> 00:03:00,320
also need a short length of elastic to put around the top your bottle I don't

37
00:03:00,416 --> 00:03:05,632
actually think this step is necessary so you could leave out the elastic bit and to

38
00:03:05,695 --> 00:03:09,055
be honest to be a lot easier because that was the hardest part so to begin

39
00:03:09,119 --> 00:03:13,343
with you need to stitch the side seam of the outer peace and the side seam

40
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:17,279
of the lining peace the lining is a bit longer just because it holds down I'm

41
00:03:17,408 --> 00:03:21,951
and has the elastic casing section so there I am just I'm I'm using quilting pegs

42
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:23,423
just because it's a little bit quicker

43
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:32,800
and then I've taken it off to the sewing machine to so those seems down so

44
00:03:32,927 --> 00:03:37,824
although mentioned I've used a small team of one centimeter that you could do it and

45
00:03:37,951 --> 00:03:42,048
wider all shorten that handing him like and then I've just trimmed it with the pinking

46
00:03:42,175 --> 00:03:45,695
shears just because you don't want to much bulk on that now because I've used quite

47
00:03:45,727 --> 00:03:50,688
a different lining fabric I have had to then change over to a different threatened bobbing

48
00:03:51,039 --> 00:03:53,440
so I'll be doing a lot dropping changing during this

49
00:03:56,511 --> 00:04:00,671
so after that I then pressed the seams out so let that lie flat

50
00:04:04,927 --> 00:04:11,264
right so next I folded down the top edge of the lining peace so I've roaded

51
00:04:11,328 --> 00:04:17,791
it down so that I've got the elastic casing section folded down and the seam allowance

52
00:04:17,855 --> 00:04:21,023
so you can see I'm using my seem go chair which I mentioned in a previous

53
00:04:21,088 --> 00:04:25,312
bit video that I might like to use and it's just a nice quick reference and

54
00:04:25,376 --> 00:04:29,440
if you don't want to use your take measure and but obviously a tape measure is

55
00:04:29,696 --> 00:04:31,007
just as easy to use

56
00:04:33,791 --> 00:04:39,808
okay so after that I then folded down the seam allowance for the out of fabric

57
00:04:39,903 --> 00:04:45,247
so again so this was only one centimeter I would say actually it's probably a bit

58
00:04:45,407 --> 00:04:49,696
easier and gives you a bit more margin for error if you

59
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:54,111
increase the simulants at the top of it just because it might be a bit easier

60
00:04:54,528 --> 00:04:57,376
to unstitch it all together at the end

61
00:04:58,783 --> 00:05:00,127
just something to bear in mind

62
00:05:01,216 --> 00:05:04,384
see yeah so I pressed that will down but because I had the fusible fleece on

63
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:09,824
it it wasn't really holding itself down that well especially because it's only a one sense

64
00:05:09,855 --> 00:05:13,696
to me to seam allowance so I've just added quoting clips just to keep it in

65
00:05:13,791 --> 00:05:18,623
place while I get on with the next step right the next step is to stitch

66
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:23,071
around to the base pieces so and this is just because I'm

67
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:28,384
you'll then going to cost into the base layer in a moment so here I am

68
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:30,048
just switching back to the other color

69
00:05:31,359 --> 00:05:35,776
get my head in the way of the camera see again just I'm working from the

70
00:05:35,839 --> 00:05:38,239
raw edge to stitching on the seam allowance line

71
00:05:42,623 --> 00:05:47,615
okay so then I went and caught at regular intervals up to that stitching line just

72
00:05:47,648 --> 00:05:52,096
because then it makes it easier for you to attach the base peace to your main

73
00:05:52,608 --> 00:05:59,071
pieces for the carrier so here I am I'm just attaching the light mainlining peace to

74
00:05:59,264 --> 00:06:05,088
the base lining peace so with those notches cost into it just makes it so much

75
00:06:05,247 --> 00:06:10,239
easier to to mold it into the shape and as it is a circle it does

76
00:06:10,303 --> 00:06:14,528
make it a bit trickier and then I repeated this with the outer pieces as well

77
00:06:14,847 --> 00:06:20,832
again the quoting clips are nice and easy to use and but obviously if you're feeling

78
00:06:20,895 --> 00:06:25,471
a bit unsure about stitching and round in the circle what you could do as well

79
00:06:25,631 --> 00:06:27,359
is I'm do a bit attacking

80
00:07:11,295 --> 00:07:16,256
so next I cut my elastic so here I'm just measuring it with the top of

81
00:07:16,704 --> 00:07:21,920
the water bottle that I'm using stare have just taken the measurement there and then I've

82
00:07:22,015 --> 00:07:28,127
just allowed a bit of room to overlap the two ends of the elastic to stitch

83
00:07:28,223 --> 00:07:31,903
them together so I am just holding the maybe each other and I'm just going to

84
00:07:32,704 --> 00:07:37,023
stitch those together with a straight stitch but all purply reinforced it a couple of times

85
00:07:37,471 --> 00:07:42,752
so that its secure once I did that I then tucked it up into the lining

86
00:07:43,679 --> 00:07:48,351
peace and where the casing is and just clip to into place there I also put

87
00:07:48,415 --> 00:07:52,895
the lining into the main bit of fabric so that they were wrong sides together I'm

88
00:07:53,119 --> 00:07:57,696
just in preparation for later on when it's all stitched together so again I've just used

89
00:07:57,727 --> 00:08:01,824
closing clip says to keep the elastic right at the top just because I didn't want

90
00:08:01,855 --> 00:08:07,424
to stitch it in when I secure the two fits together however it probably is better

91
00:08:07,552 --> 00:08:12,063
if you either tack it in place or you use pens because I did find that

92
00:08:12,127 --> 00:08:15,615
is lit quite about okay so now we're into the straps on the strap basis so

93
00:08:15,839 --> 00:08:19,104
you need to ensure that you've put interfacing on all of your pieces to start with

94
00:08:19,231 --> 00:08:26,239
so to begin with you need to fold up one long edge of your struck pieces

95
00:08:26,847 --> 00:08:32,640
so you just here I'm just forwarding the seam allowance and on so that its meeting

96
00:08:32,831 --> 00:08:36,799
the back of the bit of fabric so the wrong side and then I'm just repeating

97
00:08:36,895 --> 00:08:41,343
it with the other strap peace and then repeated this with the strap faces as well

98
00:08:41,471 --> 00:08:46,208
so just along one of the long edges put up a one sensory to seam allowance

99
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:48,127
and pressed it in place

100
00:09:15,104 --> 00:09:22,848
case the next I pinned together the outer strap peace with the lining strap peace and

101
00:09:22,943 --> 00:09:27,552
pinned it along the long edge that I hadn't folded at him down on I was

102
00:09:27,583 --> 00:09:32,064
so did this with the strap basis as well so I put one lining peace with

103
00:09:32,159 --> 00:09:36,864
one of the outer pieces so next I stitched all the way down the sides will

104
00:09:36,895 --> 00:09:41,440
be down the long side but with the main strap peace I also so to the

105
00:09:41,504 --> 00:09:45,280
short end down as well using the one centimeter seam allowance

106
00:09:57,216 --> 00:10:00,736
once I had done that I turned to the corners on the strap peace just so

107
00:10:00,799 --> 00:10:05,184
that I could get a nice point on the edge and then I turned it around

108
00:10:05,504 --> 00:10:09,536
the hair I I'm just I'm turning it right side out and pegging it in place

109
00:10:09,888 --> 00:10:14,591
ready for when I do my topstitching because I'm using interfacing it's it's staying in place

110
00:10:14,656 --> 00:10:18,656
quite well but obviously you could press at this stage I said it the same with

111
00:10:18,752 --> 00:10:20,831
the threat faces so I just turned it

112
00:10:22,143 --> 00:10:26,528
so that the right sides were facing out obviously with the strap basis I just left

113
00:10:26,687 --> 00:10:30,495
the short edges role because I didn't need to worry about those and because that the

114
00:10:30,591 --> 00:10:34,239
only inside of the water bottle carrier of the main section

115
00:10:38,239 --> 00:10:42,528
wrote soon next I assembled the adjustable strap so I'm going to do my best to

116
00:10:42,591 --> 00:10:46,656
trying to explain this because it's one of these things where I just kind of fumbled

117
00:10:46,719 --> 00:10:50,911
along and worked it out in the end looking at another bag I think that anyway

118
00:10:51,039 --> 00:10:56,447
so what you need to start with is you will need your strap cheese will costs

119
00:10:56,736 --> 00:11:01,184
and the slider you will need to slide one swivel class on to the strap with

120
00:11:01,247 --> 00:11:04,831
the clip slides on the right sides of the strap he then need to add the

121
00:11:04,895 --> 00:11:10,848
slider after this feeding the strap above the middle line on on the slider but under

122
00:11:10,911 --> 00:11:14,943
the outer sections of the sliders your kind of going under the outer edge over the

123
00:11:15,007 --> 00:11:19,807
middle line and under the other average then you need to from the short end of

124
00:11:19,872 --> 00:11:25,343
the strap underneath itself so that the slide is no caught between the strap so the

125
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:30,719
lining should be I'm facing each other and the outer fabric should be only outside then

126
00:11:30,911 --> 00:11:34,719
stitch across the width of the strap place to the short edge to secure the slider

127
00:11:34,783 --> 00:11:38,848
in place bring the remaining short edge underneath the other end so that the swivel class

128
00:11:39,007 --> 00:11:44,416
and slider down one end and the lining side is showing on the remaining and focus

129
00:11:44,479 --> 00:11:48,512
remaining and over on itself and goes through the slider as before by going under the

130
00:11:48,607 --> 00:11:54,080
first edge leaving the strap over the middle section and dipping back under the outer edge

131
00:11:54,528 --> 00:11:58,559
pull through this end until the swivel club pull through this end until they attached to

132
00:11:58,591 --> 00:12:04,096
spittle class and slider it down the other end slight the remaining swivel class on Cilician

133
00:12:04,255 --> 00:12:08,192
ends of the strap with the class and showing on the outer side fold over the

134
00:12:08,288 --> 00:12:11,935
end so that the lining sides of the strap are facing each other stitch in place

135
00:12:12,031 --> 00:12:16,223
close to the short edge of the strap right so if you call that then you

136
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:21,056
should have an adjustable strap done finally you need to assemble the main carrier so we

137
00:12:21,151 --> 00:12:25,375
see could do this before doing the adjustable strap but for some reason I decided to

138
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:29,119
get the strap over and done with I think I was just avoiding this section to

139
00:12:29,184 --> 00:12:33,984
be honest and because using elastic it is quite tricky to do this section so receive

140
00:12:34,047 --> 00:12:37,695
you don't need to use a brilliant avoid up so you need to fold the to

141
00:12:38,047 --> 00:12:42,432
strap faces and to so that the outer fabric is on display and start a daring

142
00:12:42,559 --> 00:12:48,512
on each select there in the fold of the strap face position pin intact them in

143
00:12:48,607 --> 00:12:53,760
place I would actually recommend stitching them to the out of fabric before attaching the lining

144
00:12:53,984 --> 00:12:57,632
and which obviously I haven't done here but I would recommend doing x it we just

145
00:12:57,695 --> 00:13:01,760
make it a lot easier still yeah and if you haven't already slight the lining piece

146
00:13:01,888 --> 00:13:05,888
into the outer peace that the wrong sides are facing each other can tackle the way

147
00:13:06,015 --> 00:13:11,648
around ensuring the raw edges of the strap bases are enclosed and then topstitch all the

148
00:13:11,679 --> 00:13:16,831
way around I would recommend during a couple of race of stitching just because it will

149
00:13:17,343 --> 00:13:19,135
reinforce it and make it a lot stronger

150
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:39,424
finally attach the strap hope you will to go to inside and you're done

151
00:13:50,304 --> 00:13:56,223
okay so just a few thought after the tutorial that I initially recorded so I've had

152
00:13:56,288 --> 00:14:01,632
this carrier for a few weeks out so I've been able to test this out and

153
00:14:01,791 --> 00:14:06,880
on the her I'm happy with it I don't think there's too many issues it is

154
00:14:06,943 --> 00:14:11,455
quite a tight fit and that's just because I didn't really add any wiggle room for

155
00:14:11,487 --> 00:14:16,192
it but I mean it makes sure that it doesn't slip out so I'm fairly happy

156
00:14:16,255 --> 00:14:20,960
with that and but it does overseeing it's a little bit tricky as to slide on

157
00:14:21,023 --> 00:14:25,567
and off one thing I probably would change and the only reason I didn't do it

158
00:14:25,952 --> 00:14:29,440
I'm on this one was because I didn't have the resources and I just want to

159
00:14:29,471 --> 00:14:33,536
get on with it but instead of using a last stick up here is to attach

160
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:38,143
a drawstring cord instance and then you can adjust it it could also make it a

161
00:14:38,176 --> 00:14:43,135
bit more best time see could use it for a different side water bottle they probably

162
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:47,200
would still need it to be roughly the same height another thing to note is that

163
00:14:47,359 --> 00:14:49,760
I probably should have made these and

164
00:14:51,231 --> 00:14:58,335
these unstraps that the Deering's are on they could have been a bit smaller so they

165
00:14:58,400 --> 00:15:03,200
didn't need about this tool I think I decided to make in this big just because

166
00:15:03,455 --> 00:15:09,408
the actual water bottle it is quite tall so I think it's fine for this bottle

167
00:15:09,471 --> 00:15:11,487
but if you had one that had a much

168
00:15:12,895 --> 00:15:18,432
smaller lead you could over teacher in that down it could definitely behalf of the length

169
00:15:18,495 --> 00:15:22,752
that I've caught at him so these are just thinks to bear in mind defending the

170
00:15:22,783 --> 00:15:27,520
last bottle that you're using in particular but otherwise already happen with the shape I like

171
00:15:27,648 --> 00:15:29,919
that it you know designed to mold around

172
00:15:31,007 --> 00:15:36,320
the water or so the straps really handy it's really handy that it's adjustable so I

173
00:15:36,447 --> 00:15:41,440
can move it from being cross-body to just over one shoulder nothing I did as at

174
00:15:41,471 --> 00:15:46,239
the end was I that some of that weatherproof spray on it which is suitable for

175
00:15:46,367 --> 00:15:51,392
fabrics and shoes I just thought that this would help it last a bit longer because

176
00:15:51,968 --> 00:15:56,351
I want to work so it just means that it's more likely to withstand the elements

177
00:15:56,960 --> 00:16:00,640
and for a lot longer that's it from me today I hope you enjoyed it and

178
00:16:00,703 --> 00:16:01,471
thanks for watching
