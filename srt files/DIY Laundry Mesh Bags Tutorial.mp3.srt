hello today I'm going to show you how to make a mesh laundry bag so you

1
00:00:04,064 --> 00:00:08,928
don't need to much for this project you need some sort of net based fabric so

2
00:00:09,248 --> 00:00:13,567
I've got this fabric here you also need a zip that's

3
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:19,423
just a bit over the width that you want your mesh bag to be you'll need

4
00:00:19,488 --> 00:00:24,000
some matching thread you'll need a zipper fit and a regular press of it for your

5
00:00:24,096 --> 00:00:31,583
sewing machine I decided to make mine so that the ends bag was roughly twenty six

6
00:00:31,615 --> 00:00:37,984
centimeters with wise and thirty-six centimeters height twice but obviously you can adjust this depending on

7
00:00:38,175 --> 00:00:42,144
the zip you've got all the size that you want your Longy mesh bag to be

8
00:00:42,335 --> 00:00:45,951
something else to highlight as well which I really should have done at this stage because

9
00:00:46,208 --> 00:00:50,304
I did end up pulling the zipper of my that my zip was one of those

10
00:00:50,335 --> 00:00:54,847
ships on a role that you can buy and if you haven't seen them before essentially

11
00:00:55,136 --> 00:00:59,872
it's a really long bit of dip Tate and you get ten slider's on it and

12
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,551
you get to decide how long the Zip's going to be so it's um it can

13
00:01:03,583 --> 00:01:06,944
be quite economical it's really great if you want to use is it for something like

14
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:11,167
this and you want to Taylor it to the sides that you want it means that

15
00:01:11,199 --> 00:01:14,047
you don't have to cut down a large as it size you can cut it to

16
00:01:14,111 --> 00:01:17,695
the sides that you want but if you do that I would suggest just doing a

17
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:22,431
little zigzag stitch just like the I'm and six at you do for a button whole

18
00:01:22,559 --> 00:01:25,727
I'm at the top and bottom of the Boston hope if you just secure pits and

19
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:29,216
stitches at either end of the zip once you've cut the bit as it take you

20
00:01:29,311 --> 00:01:33,695
want otherwise you can accidentally and put the slider right off the end which is what

21
00:01:33,888 --> 00:01:38,879
I did during recording anyway so first step is to place one short end of the

22
00:01:38,944 --> 00:01:43,456
mesh fabric over the zip with the zip facing upward towards you and line the edges

23
00:01:43,519 --> 00:01:47,552
to me to each other pin in place and stitch together using your zip of it

24
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:50,975
so what you want to do is to place the zip slider in the middle of

25
00:01:51,008 --> 00:01:54,751
the track because it's going to get in the way of your stitching otherwise so once

26
00:01:54,816 --> 00:01:58,463
you get close to the slider you can then move the machine needles so that it's

27
00:01:58,624 --> 00:02:02,816
in the down position so that you won't use your spot in your stitching then with

28
00:02:02,879 --> 00:02:08,639
the precipice up you can then wiggle the slider and push it into the section that

29
00:02:08,671 --> 00:02:13,792
you've already stitched you can then re-adjust your stitching put the presser foot down and carry

30
00:02:13,856 --> 00:02:17,951
on stitching right through to the other end to finish off the line once you've done

31
00:02:18,016 --> 00:02:21,343
that you need to press the fabric back on itself at that stitch line you've just

32
00:02:21,408 --> 00:02:25,216
made so that it is no longer covering the zip track and then using a regular

33
00:02:25,311 --> 00:02:29,824
machine for stitch a straight line of topstitching down there to keep the mesh fabric away

34
00:02:29,951 --> 00:02:34,944
from the zip section you may need to adjust where your needle is depending on how

35
00:02:35,391 --> 00:02:40,927
wide your it is next places it back down on your table with the zip facing

36
00:02:41,087 --> 00:02:45,151
up again without twisting the fabric you need to bring the other short end of the

37
00:02:45,184 --> 00:02:49,279
mesh fabric over the zip and line it up with the other edge of the zip

38
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:53,856
like before you need to stitch it in place again I'd put the slider about halfway

39
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:58,399
to two thirds down stitch the first section and then when you're coming up to the

40
00:02:58,559 --> 00:03:03,679
slider you can then put your so much a needle down move the slider up to

41
00:03:03,744 --> 00:03:07,167
the bit you've already stitched and then carry on stitching the rest of the line when

42
00:03:07,231 --> 00:03:11,360
you're doing the second sighed you do need to be careful that you you don't accidentally

43
00:03:11,455 --> 00:03:16,160
stitch the looped a bit fabric in with you zipper once again you'll need to topstitch

44
00:03:16,223 --> 00:03:19,679
it so if you fall the fabric back you might need to twist it so its

45
00:03:19,744 --> 00:03:23,968
right side out and then you can stitch down a nice neat line with your regular

46
00:03:24,255 --> 00:03:28,031
press effort so now you should have a leap of mesh fabric attached to is it

47
00:03:28,095 --> 00:03:32,160
the next step is to make the side scenes so for the side scenes I have

48
00:03:32,223 --> 00:03:36,895
decided to use a French theme just because this will make it last a little bit

49
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:41,184
longer and this will be Hering in the washing machine quite a lot and it's going

50
00:03:41,279 --> 00:03:45,664
to be taking the brunt of the cycle with the zip right side out you need

51
00:03:45,695 --> 00:03:48,223
to decide where you would like you as it to appear on the front of the

52
00:03:48,255 --> 00:03:52,768
bag so with the one that I'm doing currently I wanted the top of the zip

53
00:03:52,863 --> 00:03:56,160
to be about five centimeters down from the top edge so what I did was I

54
00:03:56,255 --> 00:04:00,735
adjusted the loop of fabric accordingly and then I used these little pegs to pack it

55
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:04,703
in place once I was happy with how it was picked up I then stitched both

56
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:09,727
side seams now I allowed about a cupolas enemy to the seam allowance at the side

57
00:04:09,888 --> 00:04:14,656
so what I had to do was stitch the first scene for my French seem so

58
00:04:14,944 --> 00:04:19,455
at the moment its right side out I then stitched the side using a just under

59
00:04:19,743 --> 00:04:23,872
one centimeter seem alone so I'm actually using the edge of my regular sewing machine press

60
00:04:23,903 --> 00:04:28,000
stuffers to guide me how so once I'd done these two seems the first seems in

61
00:04:28,063 --> 00:04:32,480
the French seem process are you still got the zip right side out I then turned

62
00:04:32,544 --> 00:04:37,503
it wrong side out and pressed the corners out and the edges so that I had

63
00:04:37,567 --> 00:04:41,760
a nice sharp edge I decided to use a pressing cloth just because you do need

64
00:04:41,824 --> 00:04:46,175
to be a bit careful sips just in case and you accidentally melt the plastic on

65
00:04:46,239 --> 00:04:50,496
them and then it might not work again so I've just used a pressing cloth here

66
00:04:50,559 --> 00:04:54,015
just to be a bit careful now that you've pressed it the next thing you'll need

67
00:04:54,079 --> 00:04:59,040
to do is stitch the second stage of your friend seems so I did a proper

68
00:04:59,104 --> 00:05:02,592
one centimeter seam allowance so I used the guide on my sewing machine for this one

69
00:05:02,976 --> 00:05:06,847
and just stitched right down those side seams again it's worth noting that you need to

70
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:10,592
be a bit careful with when you go across the zip-tie just because there is a

71
00:05:10,656 --> 00:05:15,808
slight risk that you could accidentally break or bend your machine needle so I always go

72
00:05:15,936 --> 00:05:19,903
a bit slower when I'm getting to the the zip-tie so once you've seen both sides

73
00:05:20,223 --> 00:05:24,480
and the French seems with it wrong-side out you can then turn it back so the

74
00:05:24,544 --> 00:05:28,704
right sides facing out again and what I did was give it a good press again

75
00:05:28,864 --> 00:05:32,415
so I've got some nice sharp corners and there you have it so weary seek it

76
00:05:32,575 --> 00:05:36,640
at any other embellishments if you want to you could make it so that it wasn't

77
00:05:36,704 --> 00:05:41,279
completely made out of this mesh fabric especially if you don't have much metals net style

78
00:05:41,343 --> 00:05:44,992
fabric you could make it so that it's more of a window or perhaps the front

79
00:05:45,119 --> 00:05:49,440
section is mesh and the back could be just a fabric of your choice so there's

80
00:05:49,503 --> 00:05:53,088
lots of different ways you could bury it you could add a bit cotton tape or

81
00:05:53,152 --> 00:05:57,055
perhaps a bit of ribbon on to the slider just to help you move that across

82
00:05:57,152 --> 00:06:01,631
all sorts always to personalize it but I just thought it's quite nice practical project which

83
00:06:01,727 --> 00:06:05,088
you can use around the house that's it for this time thanks for watching
